However, many people born in the US, such as enslaved people, were denied citizenship until [the 14th Amendment formally codified the right](https://www.usconstitution.net/14th-amendment-birthright-citizenship/) in 1868.

One of the key economic debates of the past few decades has been the impact of globalization on domestic industries and workers. Supporters of free trade argue that it lowers prices, increases efficiency, and promotes economic growth. Critics, however, contend that offshoring and free trade agreements have contributed to job losses in manufacturing and other sectors, leading to wage stagnation and economic insecurity for many workers.

Both major political parties have supported free trade policies at various points. For example, during his presidency, Barack Obama championed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as a way to expand trade ties, though critics argued it would encourage more offshoring of jobs. The agreement was ultimately scrapped by President Trump, who instead imposed tariffs and renegotiated NAFTA into the USMCA, aiming to protect American workers.

Trump’s tariffs have faced significant opposition from various stakeholders, including economists and business leaders, who argue that such measures could lead to increased costs for consumers and strained international relations. However, many of these critics have not offered alternative solutions to address the offshoring of jobs and the decline of domestic manufacturing.

In recent years, both left- and right-wing politicians have expressed concerns about trade agreements, outsourcing, and reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly after the economic disruptions of COVID-19. Some advocate for tariffs, reshoring incentives, or stricter trade policies to protect domestic jobs, while others warn that such measures could lead to increased costs and trade conflicts.

Given these competing perspectives, what policies do you think best balance the benefits of globalization with the need to maintain stable employment and wages for domestic workers? Were Obama’s trade policies the right approach, or did Trump’s tariffs and reshoring efforts provide a better alternative? Should the U.S. focus more on free trade or protecting domestic industries in the coming years? Additionally, what viable alternatives exist to tariffs for encouraging the reshoring of jobs and revitalizing domestic manufacturing?

1j3uc4k,Reddit,2025-03-05T06:56:48Z,"President Donald Trump's address this evening labeled: ""The Renewal of the American Dream,"" was full of grand visions ranging from a great national economy and global peace as well as discussing his accomplishments \[during his second term first 43 days in office\]. 

Trump noted he had probably accomplished more in six weeks than most presidents accomplish in 4 or even 8 years. That he had the mandate to act. Highlighting the number of Executive Orders he signed. Calling Biden the worst president in U.S. history. He blamed Biden for the price of eggs and inflation and that he left the economy in shambles and now he is working to reverse inflation by lowering the energy prices and price of gas. 

He said it is called drill baby drill. He complimented Musk for eliminating appalling waste. Cting several examples such as funding DEI and assisting the undocumented and characters of Sesame Street...among many others.  

He bragged about withdrawing from the Climate Change Accord and ""Corrupt World Health Organization"" ceasing all federal foreign aid and federal hiring freeze. That he brought back free speech and asserted that government censorship has ended. He touted the new name of the Gulf of Mexico and how he finished off DEI via Executive Order. And that there are now only two Genders ""Male and Female."" Trump also noted that now increasing number of soldiers guarding the Southern borders. Resulting in significant decrease of illegal immigrants. He also declared war on the Cartels and MS 13 calling them same as ISIS Terrorists. 

He also promised to balance the budget. He is also calling for no tax on tips, none on social security retirement income and tax deductions for interest on car payments if made in American. Along with across-the-board tax cut \[like last time\]. 

He belittled the CHIPS Act and referred to Taiwan that will be investing 100 billion in a factory for CHIPS in AZ.  He also talked of new tariffs in the future against Brazil, India and EU calling it reciprocal tariffs beginning April 2, 2025. Tariffs have already been imposed and include Canada, China and Mexico. Trump asserted that tariffs protect American jobs and helps the economy. 

Trump also mentioned that Ukraine is now ready to sign the mineral deal under his leadership and that he will build on the Abrams Accord in the Middle East. Trump added towards the end of his speech that he was saved in Butler by God to make America Great Again. 

Observers, however, express concerns over tariffs as they mount in a tit for tat trade war escalating with Canada, Mexico and China \[and EU under threat of trade war as well\], could weigh on the U.S. economy adversely impacting the national economy and the world at large, absent a quick cessation.

More specifically the U.S. imposed tariffs of 25 percent of Canadian goods with the exception for energy products, which face a 10 percent tariff. Trump also put a 25 percent tariff on imports from Mexico and an additional 10 percent on Chinese goods; raising the total to from 20 to 25%.

Within minutes of the United States hiking tariffs Beijing announced a slew of retaliatory measures. The moves included a 10-15 per cent increase in tariffs on certain US imports, export restrictions on some critical minerals, the addition of two US companies to a Chinese government blacklist, and an antitrust investigation targeting American tech giant Google. According to economists China’s moves were carefully calibrated – as some of them will hit areas that US President Donald Trump most cares about.

Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau said Ottawa would respond with immediate 25% tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of U.S. imports and on another $86.2 billion if Trump's tariffs were still in place in 21 days. Adding that Americans will pay more for gas and groceries as a result. Separately, Premier Doug Ford canceled $100 million Starlink contract in tariff response ""It’s done, it’s gone.”

President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico will respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. She will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday in a public event in Mexico City’s Central Plaza. Perhaps, giving time to Trump to reconsider.

Given concerns over tariffs, Musk initiated government dismantling, Ukranian uncertainty and Gaza conflict can one or more of his visions still come to fruition?

***Are there*** any rising stars within the party who could take on such a role?

Looking at past trends, successful Democratic nominees like Barack Obama (who served brief terms as a State and U.S. Senator from Illinois) and Bill Clinton (who served two longer terms as Governor of Arkansas) emerged early in their careers before making a surprise run for the executive. For myself, some names that could come up in these discussions include:

* **Gretchen Whitmer** – Governor of Michigan
* **Raphael Warnock** – Junior Senator of Georgia
* **Pete Buttigieg** – Former mayor and previous Transportation Secretary
* **Josh Shapiro** – Governor of Pennsylvania
* **Jared Polis** – Governor of Colorado
* **Wes Moore** – Governor of Maryland
* **Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez** – U.S. representative of New York (and likely de-facto representative of the Progressive wing)

Are there any lesser-known figures who should be on our radar? Could any of these candidates replicate Obama’s meteoric rise, or are we looking at a more traditional nomination process for 2028?

Putin initially made comments that he welcomed the initiative taken by Trump and he is all for the peace proposal which he expects to be permanent and long lasting.     

Zelensky is not impressed by the Russian response so far and tonight in his nightly address labeled Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambivalent response to a proposed ceasefire as ""very manipulative.""

""We now have all heard...Putin's very predictable, very manipulative words in response to the idea of a ceasefire.""

Putin told journalists during a joint press conference with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Moscow on Thursday. *“We absolutely support it,”* he added.

*“We endorse the idea of resolving the conflict through peaceful means,”* the president insisted.

Certain issues still need to be discussed and resolved before a truce can be reached, Putin stated, adding that Moscow particularly needs to discuss them with the US. The dialogue could also require a personal conversation with US President Donald Trump, the Russian leader said.

I am not sure what Putin actually wants, perhaps \[as expected\] he did not reject the offer proposed, yet his ""nuances comments"" raises significant concerns about a quick peace deal even a 30 day long only. It is possible perhaps he may agree to it after some sanctions are lifted or perhaps it will just be a long drawn out ""future talks"" while the war goes on.

My particular concern is in regards to constitutional checks and balances: whether the Executive and the Legislative branches are wielding proportionate power that can rein in one another; but feel free to point out pros and cons in other political contexts.  
  
I have heard a lot of chatter advocating for voting ""no"" on this Continuing Resolution \(CR\).  
Over [an interview with Chris Hayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=59), Senator Schumer \(D-NY\) claimed voting ""no"" leads to a shutdown, and this would allow the Exec. branch to arbitrarily and unilaterally (albeit temporarily, see below) determine which government functions are essential \(or not\), quickly shutting down a wide swarth of agencies and forcing workers out by furlough (unpaid time-off).  

However, on [his opinion piece published on NY times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/opinion/trump-musk-shutdown-senate.html), he claimed that should the shutdown drag on, it would be up to Congress to make those determinations.  
>In a protracted shutdown, House and Senate Republicans could bring bills to the floor to reopen only their favored departments and agencies while leaving other vital services that they don’t like to languish[,]  
  
wrote Sen. Schumer. It seems to me that is one way for the Legislature to retain some measure of control.  

On the other hand, should the CR pass, it will mean strengthening the Exec. branch and weakening the Legislative.  
>“It is not a simple stopgap that keeps the lights on and the doors open,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. “This is Republican leadership handing over the keys of the government, and a blank check to Elon Musk and to President Trump.”

1jbgrch,Reddit,2025-03-15T01:52:46Z,"Today, 10 Democrats voted to advance a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. Conveniently, the 3 Democrats who voted for this and are up for re-election in 2026 (Peters, Shaheen and Durbin) have either announced their retirement or are expected to announce their retirement. 

Rep. Thomas Massie was the sole House Republican to vote against the bill. On March 11th, he stated on Twitter that Senate Democrats already cut a deal with Republicans and they will vote for the bill. Massie stated in a Twitter video: ""I thought you’d like to know about the fake fight going on in the House of Representatives right now over this CR. They are trying to pitch it as a conservative CR versus liberal Democrats, and even the Democrats are going along in the House. But let me tell you why that’s a fake fight. They plan to pass it with all the Republicans here in the House but after we leave town, the Democrats are going to vote for it in the Senate. That’s right, they’re going to need about eight Democrats to vote for this thing over in the Senate. That means that this deal has already been cut, that Mike Johnson has cut a deal with the Senate Democrats, Senate leadership and even Hakeem Jeffries—he’s in on this. So that they can pitch their fake fight here in the House."" He argued that Mike Johnson sending Representatives home a day early is proof that Johnson knows a deal has been cut with Senate Democrats: ""If you thought there was really a threat of them not passing it in the Senate, why would you leave town?""

During Biden's term, Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Senator Joe Manchin were consistently the two holdouts on passing Democratic legislation. Senator Joe Lieberman was notoriously the sole Democrat (turned Independent) that blocked the public option in President Obama's Affordable Care Act.

Definition of Rotating Villain:

>In American democracy, when the majority party has enough votes to pass populist legislation, party leaders designate a scapegoat who will refuse to vote with the party thereby killing the legislation. The opposition is otherwise inexplicable and typically comes from someone who is safe or not up for re-election. This allows for maximum diffusion of responsibility.

>*""WHAT? Senator Lieberman now opposes the same health care compromise he himself suggested. Just when everyone thought Democrats had enough votes to get this done. Guess they made Lieberman the rotating villain...""*

Those who believe in the rotating villain theory argue that Lieberman played that role during the Obama years. Sinema and Manchin played that role during the Biden years. Now these 10 Democrats are playing the role.

Currently, Republicans control both chambers of Congress, as well as the Presidency. Mid-term voters have typically registered dissatisfaction with the federal government by curtailing the power of then current majorities, particularly when the President's party holds a majority of the seats.

After Friday's vote, Schumer further explained that he, along with several other Democrats, gave assenting votes because they were concerned that voters would blame the Democratic Party for the shutting down of the federal government or partly attribute the dysfunction of the federal government to actions their party has taken.

Some political theorists argue that culture wars—such as debates over gender identity, immigration, and consumer politics—are intentionally used by political and economic elites to divert attention from class struggle. This idea is rooted in the concept of class conflict diversion, where issues of identity and social division are amplified to prevent class consciousness and collective action against economic inequality.

For example, during Donald Trump’s presidency, cultural issues like immigration, transgender rights, and NFL protests were frequently in the spotlight. Critics argue that this focus helped shift public attention away from economic policies such as tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation, which primarily benefited corporations and the upper class. By emphasizing cultural conflicts, did Trump and similar political figures prevent a broader discussion on wealth inequality?

Do you think culture wars function as a distraction from economic issues, or do they represent legitimate struggles that exist alongside class struggle? How should socialist or labor movements engage with these issues?

1jq3q1v,Reddit,2025-04-03T02:52:58Z,"**Background**

Today, the US President [announced tariffs](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/02/trump-tariffs-april-2-liberation-day) on 76 countries (49 plus the European Union), bringing the average effective US tariff rate to the [highest since 1872.](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-economic-and-distributional-effects-20-broad-tariff)

This is a two-part question. 

**Goals?**

First, what are the goals of the tariffs? 

In the announcement, Trump said, ""We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers."" 

I can see a certain kind of logic in the first point there. If imported goods become more expensive, it stands to reason that at least *some* production would move to domestic facilities. For example, 18 car companies already [have plants in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automobiles_manufactured_in_the_United_States) If their imported models are subject to higher tariffs, they could theoretically shift production of those to US sites. Is that feasible? I don't really understand how tariffs pry open foreign markets.

The announced tariffs also claim to pursue ""fairness"" and ""rebalancing"" in trade. What's the evidence that US trade is unfair and imbalanced now?

Are those the main goals of this policy shift and is there historical precedent for tariffs achieving them? 

**Legality?**

My second question is about the legality of this action. 

The US Constitution explicitly [grants the Congress,](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i#article-section-8) not the President, the power to levy duties. 

In the [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/) announcing today's moves, Trump claims authority under the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act) which authorizes the president to regulate international commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to any unusual and extraordinary threat to the country. What is the threat on which the president is declaring a national emergency?

The order also claims authorities under the ""section 604 of the [Trade Act of 1974,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Act_of_1974) as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code.""

[Trump requested](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48842428) a military parade to celebrate the Fourth of July in 2019, but that was denied due to the logistical challenges of getting America's armaments to D.C., and the damage tanks and other heavy weaponry do to roads, just by driving on them.

While America [has held military parades before](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/02/actually-the-us-has-a-rich-tradition-of-military-parades-but-normally-theyre-after-military-victories-and-stuff/), typically after military victories and for a handful of inaugurations, they don't happen often in the United States because, as top comments from US servicemen and women in a r/military [post last year suggest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/196k856/why_did_usa_stop_parading/):



>(1) When you've got the biggest stick on the block, you don't need to wave it around.

>(2) The Desert Storm victory parade messed up the streets in DC. Those roads weren't built for tanks. That, along with the difficulty of getting tanks to DC, is part of why the military didn't want to do a parade for Trump. The other reason is that they don't want the president to look like a dictator.

>(3) Military parades have become synonymous with military dictatorships who have to continually show force and rattle sabers in order to keep their populations under control. We would rather not be associated with such practices. There's still plenty of parades that aren't focused on our military might that the military takes part in in some shape or form though.



Given precedent and the current political climate, in the context of the current administration's pursuit of cutting wasteful government spending, and the recent removal of many of America's military leaders, do you think President Trump's requested military parade will happen, and why or why not?

1jzf345,Reddit,2025-04-15T03:56:40Z,"In recent months, the Trump administration has begun a controversial deportation policy that involves sending immigrants to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). This facility is a maximum-security prison that holds tens of thousands of suspected gang members. 

CECOT has drawn criticism from international human rights organizations. Prisoners are often held without formal charges. They are denied access to legal counsel, and they have almost no contact with the outside world. They are confined in overcrowded cells and movement is heavily restricted. They also must remain silent almost constantly. The facility lacks proper ventilation and temperatures inside can reportedly exceed 90 degrees. Medical care is limited, and deaths in custody have been reported. Observers describe the conditions as severe and dehumanizing. 

The Trump administration has defended its policy by citing the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime statute that allows the detention or removal of foreign nationals. In one high-profile case, a Maryland resident named Kilmar Abrego García was mistakenly sent to CECOT, despite legal protections that had been granted to him. The Supreme Court later ordered the administration to “facilitate” his return. But, officials have argued that this only requires them to permit his reentry if he is released. President Bukele has declined to release him, and the administration has not pursued further action. 

More recently, President Trump has proposed extending this approach to U.S. citizens. In a meeting with President Bukele, he stated, “Home-growns are next. You gotta build about five more places.” He later added, “These are bad people. These are killers, gang members, and we are absolutely looking at sending them there.” ""You think there’s a special category of person? They’re as bad as anybody that comes in. We have bad ones too. I’m all for it.” 

In recent history, the Supreme Court has often shown a willingness to uphold the actions of President Trump. In light of that record, would it likely authorize the transfer of U.S. citizens to this El Salvador prison? Are there sufficient legal protections in place to prevent this, and is there a real danger that President Trump could begin sending US citizens to this prison?",recent month trump administration begin controversial deportation policy involve send immigrant el salvador s terrorism confinement center cecot facility maximum security prison hold ten thousand suspect gang member cecot draw criticism international human right organization prisoner often hold without formal charge deny access legal counsel almost contact outside world confine overcrowd cell movement heavily restrict also must remain silent almost constantly facility lack proper ventilation temperature inside can reportedly exceed 90 degree medical care limit death custody report observer describe condition severe dehumanize trump administration defend policy cite alien enemy act 1798 wartime statute allow detention removal foreign national one high profile case maryland resident name kilmar abrego garcía mistakenly send cecot despite legal protection grant supreme court late order administration facilitate return official argue require permit reentry release president bukele decline release administration pursue action recently president trump propose extend approach u s citizen meet president bukele state home growns next gotta build five place late add bad people killer gang member absolutely look send think s special category person re bad anybody come bad one be recent history supreme court often show willingness uphold action president trump light record likely authorize transfer u s citizen el salvador prison sufficient legal protection place prevent real danger president trump begin send us citizen prison,President Trump,-31,positive,topic_1,Ireland

m5zohxg,Reddit,2025-01-08T06:18:14Z,"There is extremely low public support among Canadians to join the US. Recent polls place support around 13%.

https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/poll-suggests-13-of-canadians-think-canada-should-become-the-51st-american-state/article_fb5adae4-5365-55f0-a2a5-0c8ccd163a82.html

Economic or military force directed towards that goal would likely lower public support further. 

Incorporating Canadians as American citizens after such an event would be beyond foolish from a domestic security perspective. 

There would be additional implications for US politics as Canadians are socially and politically much more liberal and left wing than Americans on average. With even most conservatives being in favor of abortion for example:

https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/december-2022/the-differences-between-canada-and-the-u-s-remain-significant/

Adding at least one new US state that would be expected to vote at least as left as California would cause some political shift in the new country, where elections are already decided by very small vote margins. The potential for internal immigration of some of the 40million Canadians to other US states may shift things further. 

Support to join the US is higher amongst Canadians who vote conservative (~20%), and some prominent Canadian conservatives appear to believe that most Canadians support this, despite evidence to the contrary.

I would wager this is because the people they know are not representative of the broader population. 

Frankly I am not clear that there is a logical reason for the US to pursue this. We already have an extremely close political, military, cultural, and economic relationship which seems to work well for everyone. Attempts to unilaterally change the nature of that relationship would just weaken both parties. ",extremely low public support among canadian join us recent poll place support around 13 economic military force direct towards goal likely low public support incorporate canadian american citizen event beyond foolish domestic security perspective additional implication us politic canadian socially politically much liberal leave wing american average even conservative favor abortion example add less one new us state expect vote less leave california cause political shift new country election already decide small vote margin potential internal immigration 40million canadian us state may shift thing support join us high amongst canadian vote conservative 20 prominent canadian conservative appear believe canadian support despite evidence contrary wager people know representative broad population frankly clear logical reason us pursue already extremely close political military cultural economic relationship seem work good everyone attempt unilaterally change nature relationship just weaken party,Donald Trump,16,negative,topic_1,"Copenhagen, Denmark"

Quebec tried to separate from Canada a number of times.  The final time the Canadian government produced [this map](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.9615acdaac3c4a800ef6135c42c633dc?rik=26aIpqnZVlE9gg&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oocities.org%2fathens%2fagora%2f8882%2feleque.gif&ehk=SxhIY3lKMOufU3t3NjBdqNXfrf2fbrCsqer50i9GrJM%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0) of what Quebec would look like post separation.  Essentially because the rest of that land was indigenous owned crown lands they wouldn't get that. So that news made separation unthinkable for most provinces.

They also produced a document called [The Clarity Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarity_Act).  This setout the rules for having a referendum, for separation and future actions on separation.  Because of this act, separation is almost impossible.  It requires to have approval of 7/10 of the provinces representing at least 60% of the population and a clear majority in every region.

The question itself can't be obscure about what it's asking.  And that itself is challenging.  You need to put in French and English a full document that everyone is expected to read and understand with what will change.

And then there's the numbered treaties.  Canada has signed treaties with every group in Canada except for some in BC.  And they have to be consulted.  They all have land use agreements and we provide indigenous Canadians with some benefits for that.  The US would have to honor this treaties.

It's hard to imagine anyone in the House of Commons getting behind this.

Forced annexation would be a violation of international law.

Just as Mexico never paid a peso for Trump's wall, this is another pledge that won't be kept. 

Trump has learned that he can bluster and fail to deliver on that bluster while still keeping his supporters on board.  He's trolling us.  Canada has little to fear, eh?

That being said, Alberta and Quebec are the weak links in the confederation, as is referenced in the CBC article above.  If there was ever an opportunity for the US to take parts of Canada, it would probably arise in response to an internal Canadian schism.

The Canadian union is in some ways even more fractured than it is in the US.  The Quebec secession movement occasionally poses a threat, unlike the Texans who are all hat and no cattle when it comes to their Texit talk.

m8dnir5,Reddit,2025-01-21T20:16:24Z,"The 14th Amendment to the US Constitution reads:

> ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""

Birthright citizenship was established by the Supreme Court in the case *United States v. Wong Kim Ark* in 1898. This case established that ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" applies to everyone resident in the United States who is not a diplomat or a soldier in an invading army. This decision has stood for over 120 years. ([source](https://www.kqed.org/news/12015449/a-129-year-old-san-francisco-lawsuit-could-stop-trump-from-ending-birthright-citizenship))

Trump provides no reasoning in the EO for reversing *Wong Kim Ark*. The sole legal theory to justify it comes from federal judge James C. Ho, who argues not that *Wong Kim Ark* was wrongly decided, but that Trump has the right to declare all immigrants an ""invading army."" (same source)

Actually, Ho believes that not only Trump but also states like Texas have the right to deem any resident of the US an ""invader"" and therefore shoot at them, drop bombs on them, or deploy any other type of violence used on wartime enemies. He has argued as such in a July 2024 dissent, which was joined by no one else. ([source](https://i2i.org/wp-content/uploads/US-v.-Abbott.pdf))

This could potentially bring it to the Supreme Court for a review of its constitutionality, and one possible outcome is that the Supreme Court changes the interpretation of the 14th Amendment by weakening or fully overturning its previous findings in Wong Kim Ark. Then the president's executive order, or some partial form of it, could become constitutional.

One wrinkle in the executive order: it singles out different eligibility requirements for the baby's mother vs. father. If the mother is in the US with a temporary visa or without any authorization, the child's citizenship depends on the father's status.

m8iws1l,Reddit,2025-01-22T15:26:30Z,"The argument made in Wong Kim Ark is that his parents were irrelevant.

Jus soli = from the soil.  The concept comes from feudalism, with ones loyalty going to the land (the lord of the manor.)

Wong was a US citizen because he was born on US soil.  His parents played no role whatsoever in his US citizenship.

For that matter, the laws of the time prevented his parents from becoming US citizens.  Didn't matter.

Anyone born in the US who is not the child of a diplomat is born under US jurisdiction.  There are only two pathways to citizenship: Naturalization and natural born.  Congress controls the former as an enumerated power per Article I Section 8, but not the latter.

Birthright citizenship has nothing to do with ones parents.  The US also has a jus sanguinis pathway to citizenship, but that is a matter of naturalization law passed by Congress and is not a birthright.  Congress could decide tomorrow to stop granting citizenship to those born to an American parent abroad, but it does not regulate citizenship of those born on US soil.

The exception to this is those born to foreign diplomats, as those diplomats are not subject to US jurisdiction.  In other words, their US born children have diplomatic immunity,

Agreed.  To americans when they hear birthright citizenship, they think of ""if you are born in the us, you get citizenship"".  Which as I mentioned no other western country does that (the dark blue in your map) except Canada.

But restricted birthright citizenship, where if you are a legal citizen or have legal residency of a certain period, etc, is definitely something the western world does.  THe key difference is that most of the western world cares if you are legally allowed to be in the country when assigning citizenship.  While the US has not.

The Slaughterhouse Cases in 1872 that “[t]he phrase, ‘subject to its jurisdiction’ was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States.” It then confirmed that understanding in the 1884 case of Elk v. Wilkins, holding that the “subject to the jurisdiction” phrase required that one be “not merely subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but completely subject to their political jurisdiction, and owing them direct and immediate allegiance.” John Elk, the Native American claimant in the case, did not meet that requirement because, as a mem­ber of an Indian tribe at his birth, he “owed imme­diate allegiance to” his tribe and not to the United States.

Thomas Cooley, the leading treatise writer of the era, also confirmed that “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States “meant full and complete jurisdic­tion to which citizens are generally subject, and not any qualified and partial jurisdiction, such as may consist with allegiance to some other government.”  More fundamentally, this understanding of the Citizenship Clause is the only one compatible with the consent of the governed principle articulated in the Declaration of Independence.

m8z5td8,Reddit,2025-01-24T23:46:34Z,"DC vs Heller already quite clearly settled this.  Keep, bear, and arms mean the same things in 2025 that they meant in 1791.  Every other right in the Bill of Rights is an individual right. The militia clause is clarifying that it's also a collective right, as well. See also ""Letters of Marque"" from Article I, as well as basic history that the Redcoats were trying to seize privately owned cannons and shot at Lexington and Concord.

Even if you think the Slaughterhouse cases were correct (instead of being an abominably incorrect reading like Dred Scott), you're relying on the interpretation that ignores ""subject to the jurisdiction"" which has NOT been so definitely debated before SCOTUS.  See Elk v. Wilkins, 112 U.S. 94 (1884):
  
>Chief Justice Taney, in the passage cited for the plaintiff
Page 112 U. S. 101
from his opinion in Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393, 60 U. S. 404, did not affirm or imply that either the Indian tribes, or individual members of those tribes, had the right, beyond other foreigners, to become citizens of their own will, without being naturalized by the United States. His words were:
""They [the Indian tribes] may without doubt, like the subjects of any foreign government, be naturalized by the authority of Congress and become citizens of a state and of the United States, and if an individual should leave his nation or tribe, and take up his abode among the white population, he would be entitled to all the rights and privileges which would belong to an emigrant from any other foreign people.""
But an emigrant from any foreign state cannot become a citizen of the United States without a formal renunciation of his old allegiance, and an acceptance by the United States of that renunciation through such form of naturalization as may be required law.
The distinction between citizenship by birth and citizenship by naturalization is clearly marked in the provisions of the Constitution, by which
""No person, except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution shall be eligible to the office of President,""
and ""The Congress shall have power to establish an uniform rule of naturalization."" Constitution, Article II, Section 1; Article I, Section 8. By the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution, slavery was prohibited. The main object of the opening sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment was to settle the question, upon which there had been a difference of opinion throughout the country and in this Court, as to the citizenship of free negroes (Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393), and to put it beyond doubt that all persons, white or black, and whether formerly slaves or not, born or naturalized in the United States, and owing no allegiance to any alien power, should be citizens of the United States and of the state in which they reside. Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 83 U. S. 73; Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 100 U. S. 306.

and

>to be citizens are ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof."" The evident meaning of these last words is not merely subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but completely subject to their political jurisdiction and owing them direct and immediate allegiance. And the words relate to the time of birth in the one case, as they do to the time of naturalization in the other. Persons not thus subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at the time of birth cannot become so afterwards except by being naturalized, either individually, as by proceedings under the naturalization acts, or collectively, as by the force of a treaty by which foreign territory is acquired.
Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States, members of and owing immediate allegiance to one of the Indiana tribes (an alien though dependent power), although in a geographical sense born in the United States, are no more ""born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,"" within the meaning of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, than the children of subjects of any foreign government born within the domain of that government, or the children born within the United States of ambassadors or other public ministers of foreign nations.
This view is confirmed by the second section of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that
""Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.""

Until the mid-20th century, the US banned dual nationality for adults.

The Slaughter House cases referenced that a child born with a foreign citizenship would not be American.  A child born in the US that did not take on a second citizenship would have been born under US jurisdiction.

There were subsequent cases that banned dual nationality for adults, but recognized it as a status for children.  In Perkins v Elg (1939), it was determined that a person who was born in the US to Swedish parents, then moved as a child with her parents to Sweden, could choose to return as an adult to the US with her US citizenship preserved.

Tariffs are explicitly linked to tax cuts by quoting named and unnamed Trump advisors here:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/09/11/trump-tax-cuts-2024/


This is generally considered a terrible idea. 

> CAN TARIFFS REPLACE THE INCOME TAX?

> Simply put, no. Tariffs are levied on imported goods, which totaled $3.1 trillion in 2023. The income tax is levied on incomes, which exceed $20 trillion; the US government raises about $2 trillion in individual and corporate income taxes at present. It is literally impossible for tariffs to fully replace income taxes. Tariff rates would have to be implausibly high on such a small base of imports to replace the income tax, and as tax rates rose, the base itself would shrink as imports fall, making Trump’s $2 trillion goal unattainable.

With this is a deep fear of any dilution of their personal power here in the US.   Global agreements do that.  They put limits on the whims of people like Trump.

Sovereignists:

>Their movement aimed to preserve not only America’s formal sovereignty in international relations, but also the traditional forms of rule to which its white, native-born leaders were accustomed. Driven by a keen sense of the virtues of Anglo-Saxon self-governance, they understood international cooperation as a threat to their personal sovereignty as well as that of their nation.  
...  
They resisted American participation in the International Court, which they dubbed the World Court; the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the forerunner to the World Trade Organization; viewing them all as threats to American governance. In their view, the U.N.’s covenants and agencies undermined the civilizing authority of white, Christian nations by offering membership and influence to communists, Asians and Africans.

It would take over a year to gather an invasion force sufficiently large enough to decisively steamroll into Canada and in that time period, Canada can build up their own defenses.

Much of the border is thick forests, mountains and large rivers/lakes and the one area where there’s little natural defense is faaar from population centers.

Meanwhile, even if the US manages to steamroll their way in and take over the populated areas, keeping Canada subdued would take 3 million servicemen.

So much for halving the defense department’s budget.

A lot of that high consumer spending is people shelling out more for the same stuff thanks to inflation, or even putting things on credit because they’re stretched thin – it’s not like everyone’s got loads of extra cash. And “real wage growth” can be pretty deceptive. Sure, the averages might look a little better, but that’s often skewed by a few high earners getting big raises while most workers are barely keeping up. The cost of living – especially for things like housing, healthcare, and education – has been rising even faster, so any small wage gains vanish into those bills. The typical worker’s paycheck today doesn’t go much further than it did years ago. If the middle class were truly thriving, we wouldn’t be looking at record-high wealth inequality or watching homeownership slip out of reach for so many people.

So how can real wage growth be eaten by cost of living is real wage growth means wages are growing faster than the cost of living?

Because things like, housing, healthcare, and education are rising faster than inflation. So the CPI won't fully capture those cost increases. 

Yeah, wages at the bottom grew faster than at the top for a little while, but that doesn’t mean inequality actually shrank in any meaningful way. A lot of those wage gains were due to massive labor shortages in low-wage jobs during the pandemic, and now that those are easing up, wage growth for those workers is slowing down again. Meanwhile, inflation ate up a lot of those raises, so it’s not like people suddenly became financially stable.

And let’s not pretend wealth inequality magically disappeared. Billionaires made an absolute killing during the pandemic while regular people got stimulus checks that barely covered a month of rent. The richest households still control way more wealth than the bottom 90% combined, and homeownership is further out of reach for young and working-class people than ever. If inequality really “shrunk,” we wouldn’t still be seeing record corporate profits, insane housing prices, and a stock market that’s completely disconnected from how most people are actually living.

So yeah, lower-income workers got some short-term wage gains, but acting like that erased decades of growing inequality is just nonsense.

mf8pvg4,Reddit,2025-02-28T15:39:58Z,"It's a difficult question - probably one of the most important or our time. 

I think it's phrased wrongly in the OP, though. It's not how the Democrats grow their popularity while opposing popular policies - that's sort of a contradictory statement. It's more about how and why the Democrats have become painted with the brush they have, while the Republicans have managed to maintain public trust. 

Ultimately, the public is reacting to what they see as attempts to fix a problem (even if brutal or flawed), vs not fixing the problem.

I think immigration is a good example of this.

As shown by the poll (and many other polls), the majority of the American public views recent immigration trends in a negative light - it's too uncontrolled, too focused on low income/education immigrants, too much immigration outright, etc. 

The Republican approach to that is cruel, but it's viewed by the public as at least solving the problem. 

Meanwhile, the Democrats' approach has both run counter to the general public opinion, and involved a media narrative that oozes dishonesty.

The American electorate may be relatively simple and unsophisticated, but they're not *stupid,* and they have picked up on the way that Democrats keep shifting the wordplay. ""Illegal immigrants"" becomes ""undocumented immigrants,"" and then when that becomes the butt of jokes, on to ""asylum seekers.""

Nobody was or is fooled by that game of linguistic hopscotch. It gives the impression of being untrustworthy and manipulative.

This is then compounded by things like announcing ""Sanctuary Cities"" that again run counter to public opinion, with even more eye-rolling wordplay.

Or the howling indignation across the media when Republicans used the term ""anchor babies"" - callous and rude, sure, but it was articulating a very real practical phenomenon, and the Democratic response wasn't to try and address it, but instead to dishonestly pretend it wasn't happening and to instead focus on the terminology and wordplay. 

Every step of the way, the Democrats have managed to fumble this issue in the worst way - not just by taking a contrary position, but by doing so in the context of words and actions that give the public the impression of dishonesty.

Over time, this builds up in the public mind's eye. Not just on immigration, mind you, but on a lot of topics - immigration is just a really clear example of the phenomenon.

Immigration is more of a manufactured issue for most Americans and has been viewed more as an issue because it resonated with the right wing base and right media played up the narrative [Immigration | Gallup Historical Trends](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx). During the 1990s people were not concerned about immigration as much. 

The reality is that Obama deported more people than Trump by year [Table 39. Aliens Removed or Returned: Fiscal Years 1892 to 2019 | OHSS - Office of Homeland Security Statistics](https://ohss.dhs.gov/topics/immigration/yearbook/2019/table39) From 2009 to 2014 there was net migration TO Mexico from the US.

The same story takes place for other policies, gay rights, healthcare funding, welfare benefits, tax policy... You name it. It is first an issue that should have good policy, yes. But  then becomes a wedge issue where the right wing media lies about the premise, lies about reality, and then sells their candidate as the only one paying attention to the manufactured crisis. Take social security as an example. The right says its unsustainable. The truth is that it is sustainable forever at 79% of benefits. So yes, there is a real issue that should be addressed. The right wing media says you will get nothing, reality says you get 79% but you won't see that argument from right wing media. They drive fear by having headlines like: ""[Social Security marks 89th year as retirement fund risks insolvency under Democrats](https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/social-security-marks-89th-year-retirement-fund-risks-insolvency-under-democrats)"".

mfwqslu,Reddit,2025-03-04T07:32:18Z,"What Trump has talked about is essentially a 4 stage process:

(1) Get a minerals deal with Ukraine which would give Ukraine a soft security guarantee.

(2) Get a ceasefire in Ukraine.

(3) Get a peace agreement in Ukraine. On this, he has talked about Ukraine getting back some of its territory (not the ""Russia gets everything it wants"" narrative).

(4) Provide hard security guarantees. (This may be wrapped into the peace agreement, but Trump doesn't seem to have that as a requirement, while Zelesnky does.)

Most Republicans appear to support this approach and want a fast end to the fighting.

During the meeting in the Oval Office, it seemed that Zelensky started to talk about what else needed to be negotiated later, but the conversation basically devolved into talking about it then and there, in front of the press. I think this was partly from Zelesnky being exhausted and frustrated by the process, partly by him not having a long career in politics or diplomacy, and partly a language issue (he wasn't clear enough at the start that he was talking about the longer process). And then it was just made worse by Vance (I believe) intentionally sabotaging the meeting.

It's also worth noting that Trump isn't the only leader Zelensky has clashed with. Biden yelled at him for not showing enough gratitude -- but at least he didn't do that in public.

Zelensky also often does not appear to want a ceasefire or peace agreement (at least not any of the agreements he'd be offered). He wants a complete return of all the territory, for Russia to pay for rebuilding Ukraine, and for Putin to personally be brought to justice. There is no universe in which he gets all that, but still he insists that there can be no compromise.

Zelensky's heart is in the right place, and I wish he could get everything he wanted, but it's not realistic and his ""no compromise"" position makes him at least appear pretty unreasonable.

In that context, I think it's easy to understand why most Republicans don't want to (at least publicly) break ranks with Trump, especially as they have other things to work on (most notably the budget).

As for some of the other actions Trump has taken, it's in the context of trying to broker a peace. It's hard for him to negotiate with Russia while we're actively engaged in cyber warfare against them (what was stopped was specifically offensive operations). And regarding sanctions relief, we have very few details so far, and it's quite likely a carrot to be offered conditioned on Russia agreeing to either a ceasefire or a peace deal.

mfx3j0p,Reddit,2025-03-04T09:12:46Z,"Follow the leader theory applies.  

Most voters are largely uninterested in policy.  They will affiliate with a party because it includes ""people like me"", not due to some coherent analysis of policy.

They may have one or two hot button issues (most likely visceral issues, not complex matters of policy), and will follow a candidate who they like because of those issues.  

That party and politician will then provide them with signalling about what other sides to take.  Because those voters trust people like themselves and the leader who they have chosen to follow, they will then adopt those other policies of the group and the leader.

Americans in general are uninterested in foreign policy, so they are unlikely to have strong feelings about it.  If they like Trump for other reasons, they may simply adopt his positions because his position provides affirmation for them.

Trump likes Russia.  They like Trump.  Therefore, they like Russia.  They surround themselves with others like themselves who also like Trump and therefore also like Russia, which in turn affirms that they are in good company and have made the right choice.

This is an indication that few GOP voters ever cared about Russia per se.  They disliked Russia when they were told that the Russians were godless communists.  They like them now that they seem to be tough (i.e. authoritarian.)

There isn't much motivation for other Republicans to challenge this current crop of GOP voters.  It is easier just to follow the leader.

If another Republican follows who can make it cool to hate Russia again based upon some kind of GOP-friendly metric, then the party will likely flip again.

You mean after he was impeached for illegally halting all aid? As political cover. That was back when Putin thought Ukraine would fall in 3 days.

To drive a wedge between the US and NATO members. Something he has done a dozen times now, to the point he has successfully convinced everyone that the US will not support Europe, one of Putin's most desired goals.

It is when Russia is one of the biggest origin points of cyber attacks on the US currently. We're literally deciding not to fight back. 


>any more than questioning endless Ukraine aid is “siding with Russia.


Almost all the aid we're giving was support for our own military, cycled back into American companies. We were destroying one of the biggest enemies of the United States, profiting off it, repairing all the damage Trump did to our soft power the first time around, strengthening NATO, and preserving democracy in the face of fascist authoritarian imperialism at a cost of zero American soldiers. Honestly the biggest criticism to levy at America is that we were getting such a return from Putin's own goal and we were too cowardly to support Ukraine harder. 


Also why do Republicans never complain that we give Israel more money than Ukraine for a much worse reason?


>Russia.” Sanctions have done little to stop Putin so far,


They're crippling the Russian economy. Why do you think Putin is so desperate to have them gone. Just because they didn't stop the war immediately doesn't mean they aren't working. It just means Putin is willing to take more pain, so we need to rachet them up more. 


I wholeheartedly agree Europe should step up more. If you also think so then you're admitting there is merit to helping Ukraine. Why do you want to support Russia in that case?


As for Trump trying to negotiate, he's fucking bad at it. He held a peace talk between Ukraine and Russia without inviting Ukraine and a nord stream talk without inviting any possible destination country. He made extortionate offers to Ukraine and then blew the whole thing up by staging a temper tantrum. I see no evidence he can successfully negotiate with anyone. He's also not putting tariffs on Russia, the country he needs leverage against most in order to accomplish a peace deal, so if they are about leverage than why the fuck not?

You have to defend cutting *all* of them.  Because they're taking a sledgehammer to essential services.

>You can alao check out doge.gov

I did, that's how I found things like that Department of Housing and Urban Development contract.  

Or canceling technical support for [this program](https://aas.gsa.gov/).  Or canceling a CFPB subscription to [Bloomberg Government](https://about.bgov.com/).  Or dropping an [AgencyIQ](https://www.agencyiq.com/) subscription from the department of Health and Human Services.

I have a habit of checking over details.

Speaking of, see that press release by the white house?

>For decades, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been unaccountable to taxpayers as it funnels massive sums of money to the ridiculous — and, in many cases, malicious — **pet projects of entrenched bureaucrats, with next-to-no oversight**.

Notice how the list provided then doesn't mention any of those supposed bureaucrats.  Doesn't address who was guilty of either ""WASTE"" or ""ABUSE"", with those being in all caps?  

You know what bureaucrats spend all day doing?  Following the directives set by Congress.

The problems he's complaining about have nothing to do with these ""entrenched bureaucrats"", who aren't listed, and never brought up in any of the articles cited as support.

Take the [first article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14344255/trump-millions-dei-foreign-aid-programs-funding.html).

[Here's the contract](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72016922FA00001_7200), now I guess if you hate gay people you're fine to consider it ""waste"", but ""abuse""?  A ""pet project"" by some ""entrenched bureaucrat""?  The daily mail article doesn't support that in the slightest.

Fortunately the Trump administration can rest easy knowing that the people giving me links like that won't question too deeply what it is they're claiming, versus what it is they're *doing*.

Trump and Putin also want to weaken the US, these new tariffs and trade wars with our allies work towards that. Look for a US government shutdown and a recession. Inflation is coming back, the markets will tumble, and the economy will suffer. Trump is doing what Putin wants here too. 

After decades of Rush Limbaugh, any Republican who ""works across the aisle"" is deemed a traitor and is driven from office. Working across the aisle for the good of the country used to be a plus, but now it is an invitation to lose your seat. Independent, fair-minded Republicans have been driven out of the party, what is left are the sycophants, those who crave power above all else. They will go along with Trump and Putin for their own safety and power. 

According to the Constitution, the recourse to a rogue and corrupt President is impeachment, but the GOP Senate already signaled they will never do that no matter what Trump does. The Supreme Court is also a check but they have already capitulated once and will likely keep doing that.

That leaves elections as a check on Trump, but Trump has already shown he cares nothing for the voters and will ignore them whenever he wants to. His plan in multiple states was to simply ignore the voters and replace them with his own fake electors. I'm sure he will try things like this again. The last thing Trump wants is a free and fair election.

Finally, the US military could be the last stand against this move to embrace Russia and weaken the US. But Trump has already fired many Generals and Admirals and will keep doing that unless they swear an oath to him directly, the same move Hitler made.

Are they going to be planting vast acres of new forest?  Where?  Or planning to cut down old growth?

Is the goal to boost domestic logging companies at the cost of national resources?  Should Americans be rushing to see the national parks before Trump permanently kills them?

I agree.  Let's not determine guilt before we even have all the facts of the case.  It surely seems likely based on the circumstance, but we ultimately haven't seen him do it yet.  Maybe for some reason he thinks doing what he's doing is a good thing.  I can't see how.  He's not a dumb person.  But my gut tells me he ultimately just wants to be remembered.  The type of guy that really cares about leaving a legacy.  And you'd think he'd want to leave a positivd one, which if why maybe he does think he's being a force for good.  But he seems to have lots of mental health issues at play too.

And on musk, I agree totally.  I honestly didn't really have much of an opinion on him UNTIL he became the de facto co president of my country even though he's not even eligible to run, nevermind the fact that he didn't win a majority in the electrical college.  

I found it hard to really draw a solid conclusion about him because of the sheer amount of noise that surrounded his every move.

But on the other side, the people who hate him were so invested in their hatred of them, that it was hard for me to take it seriously.

Didn't hear about that one.

Well he can't and based on what Congress is passing they aren't gonna pull it off either.

I expect that the future of the Executive while Congress is so completely paralyzed will be to pass slews of EO in the most impactful ways they can even though they only apply to the Fed. A lot of power has been passed over to the President. The power of the President to declare spurious emergencies because their party won't impeach them without dramatic cause, and sometimes not even then, lets them do a lot of things you wouldn't expect to be in their purview.

Trump's economic vision I think is doomed. Based on current trends I think the GOP should begin prepping now to craft excuses for how the prices in 2026 will totally not be their fault. Somehow.

His vision for peace is possible, but not I think super likely. Especially nuclear disarmament. Gaza I think could happen, but to be clear peace will happen because the US allows Israel to destroy the Palestinian people by forcing them into a diaspora that will likely mean the end of that nation and culture in any meaningful way.

The government is, currently, not that crippled. It's lost only, what 30K people out of over a million? And 1/3 of those were USAid. It's not hurt in any fatal way to my view.

Trump's isolationist views will likely mean the withdrawal of US influence in several key areas.

For point 2, none of Trumps policies have trickled down to effect recruiting. The gains in recruitment are solidly due to Biden era policies and appointies. Air Force and Army leaders are already concerned that having Hegseth at the wheel will reverse those trends. Much of the recruiting issues we've had since 2015 (so the last decade) can be laid at Donald Trumps feet. I wouldn't count on this one to remain consistent. The fed being hostile to trans people, we have a few thousand trans military members and quasi-hostile towards queer folk in general is going to cut down our numbers overall. 

Border crossings are not at an all time low, apprehensions and encounters at the border are at an all time low. While it is likely that border crossings have slowed, ICE wouldn't know about border crossings that successfully evaded them. Apprehensions being at an all time low is actually worrying, because it could also imply that those crossing are being more careful. This one could go either way.

What are these programs? How is the waste as opposed to operating expenses? What is the expected return?

If the answer to these questions is, 'listen to how silly some of these programs sound' ... and certainly, some of these things can sound silly or appear to be of no value. Many world changing technologies were thought of as the same. 

As far as increased military recruitment... why is this a good thing? I thought we wanted to reduce waste. This is peace time, right? Trump is a no war president ... what the fuck does the increased recruitment mean to accomplish when the other hand is reducing expense? Never mind, couldn't you also say part of the push toward enlistment might be the stalling of the economy? As the cost of living increases, young people with fewer options might seek out opportunities that at least promise to take care of things like housing and food.

As much as I'd like to dismiss the claims on immigration (mostly because I think it's silly). We have to contend with two things. 1) Measured border crossings have been trending downward since late 2023. 2) You're basically taking 1 month of data and projecting it forward as the standard...

I'm sure you can find (as I did) papers showing that other countries may not have such a measurable correlation between spending and votes. This should counter that pretty well, but admittedly I haven't taken a deep dive into the methodology.

Other than that, there are myriad reasons why campaign finance and general campaign rules should be changed. The possibility of corruption, black funding, external influence, and any number of more obvious effects tied to the money itself should be somewhat obvious. The paper above shows direct influence of money on results in the USA. The current system also (by design from the start of the country to some extent) keeps the people who can potentially run severely limited to those who can at least raise the initial funds which are substantial. The more money that needs to get raised, the more energy and effort needs to be spend on campaigning which in turn leads to less time spent actually being able to govern and be a representative. The list is... far from exhaustive.",be sure can find paper show country may measurable correlation spend vote counter pretty good admittedly haven t take deep diva methodology myriad reason campaign finance general campaign rule change possibility corruption black fund external influence numb obvious effect tie money somewhat obvious paper show direct influence money result usa current system also design start country extent keep people can potentially run severely limit can less raise initial fund substantial money need get raise energy effort need spend campaign turn lead little time spend actually able govern representative list far exhaustive,Donald Trump,4,negative,topic_1,Vancouver

Respectfully, I don't believe this is true. Democrats do loudly celebrate their victories, and Biden in particular had his strongest moments talking about his political wins in major speeches. Now, they don't tend to do it in their *first* address to congress, because in the normal course they don't have any accomplishments yet. You've just been elected, you presumably have a mandate, so you want to tell people what they'll do with that momentum. They've spent two months getting everyone confirmed and there hasn't been a legislative session, so they talk about what they plan to deliver to the people in their upcoming Presidency. But other speeches have been well-populated with applause lines. *We got the bipartisan Buy More Things bill passed, and that's going to inject 450 billion dollars into the economy, and bring 85,000 new jobs to Capital City of Swing State!*, and everyone stands and applauds.

One attack that seemed to work in the election is that Democrats were claiming all these wins but voters didn't *feel* like they were winning, so they demanded change. It's great that you passed the CHIPs act and we're going to have more domestic chip production, but the media is telling me gangs of Mexicans are going to steal my house. ""Desire for change"" was the leading issue in most post-election surveys, outpacing immigration, women's rights or the economy. I think a lot contributes to why voters didn't feel like the successes of previous administrations had a noticeable effect on their lives /*cough Fox News bullshit/*, but I don't think it's because the Democrats didn't loudly proclaim their victories. They did, however, have this old-fashioned attachment to being somewhat truthful in what they said, which I think we now know was not what the American people wanted.",major difference have notice trump speech vs generic dem biden dems always say want whereas trump tell s already do respectfully don t believe true democrat loudly celebrate victory biden particular strong moment talk political win major speech now don t tend first address congress normal course don t accomplishment yet have just elect presumably mandate want tell people will momentum have spend two month get everyone confirm hasn t legislative session talk plan deliver people upcoming presidency speech good populate applause line get bipartisan buy thing bill pass s go inject 450 billion dollar economy bring 85 000 new job capital city swing state everyone stand applaud one attack seem work election democrat claim win voter didn t feel like win demand change s great pass chip act re go domestic chip production medium tell gang mexican go steal house desire change lead issue post election survey outpace immigration woman s right economy think lot contribute voter didn t feel like success previous administration noticeable effect life cough fox news bullshit don t think s democrat didn t loudly proclaim victory however old fashion attachment somewhat truthful say think now know american people want,Donald Trump,31,neutral,topic_2,"London, England"

Within this majority, 46 percent said they strongly supported the idea, 21 percent somewhat supported it, and 12 percent opposed it.

The survey, conducted by J.L. Partners between February 24 and 25, also revealed strong cross-party support for the idea. 79 percent of Republicans and 60 percent of Democrats supported it. Additionally, 24 percent of Democrats and 29 percent of independents said receiving the check would make them more likely to vote for a Republican congressional candidate.""

But the gist is like this. Yes, taxation is (obviously) important. But it’s not a condition that makes spending possible. A powerful and productive state, like the U.S., truly can just print fiat money almost as much as it wants. 

The problem is, as the money supply accumulates from the addition of the deficit spending, you do need to remove a certain fraction of it or else you risk inflation. 

So fiscal and monetary policy are important to permit deficit spending while minimizing inflation. 

That’s part of why government bonds are important. It’s not that the U.S. has to truly “borrow money” to feed itself. No, it’s that these bonds get people to “park” their money in a stationary place, where it gets removed from circulation, thus adding to inflation control. 

My point is more that, we could just go ahead and spend money on strategic and social investments. The deficit isn’t holding us back. Now, if we were to do that, there would come a time when taxation is important.

But it’s the notion that taxation is the precedent that makes these things possible that is fallacious.

The numbers go up and down every month because the number of people migrating goes up and down. Not because border patrol all call out sick one month but not the others, or because they’re just making up numbers randomly.

These numbers express how comfortable migrants are in believing  that the trip is worth it. Or how high is the chance that they’ll make it through.

mga94m5,Reddit,2025-03-06T08:39:22Z,"A 25 percent tariff will cause exactly a 25 percent increase in prices for products from that country and even more when there are retaliatory tariffs.

Consider an example. American company currently produces their product in China. The Chinese manufacturing company has to buy some of their materials from the US and pay 25 percent more to ship those parts from the US. Then, once the Chinese manufacturing company is done, the American company has to pay another 25 percent tariff importing the finished goods into America. Thanks to the trade war, this one product now costs 50 percent more than it did before. Moving the production line back to the US makes the most sense, but it could cost millions or billions of investment and could take months or even years to complete. Trump has been known to reverse course 180 degrees overnight. How is the CEO of this company supposed to justify moving the production line back to the US, when it's entirely possible that all the tariffs disappear tomorrow.

Tariffs are supposed to encourage local businesses, but in this case, due to Trump's erratic behavior, no businesses can have the confidence they need to actually make local investments. Instead they will simply pass the increased costs down to consumers directly and try and wait out the storm hoping for the trade war to end.

mgadrot,Reddit,2025-03-06T09:17:43Z,"You have to first recognise how globalisation categorises economies. I would say there are 3 of these such categories: agrarian, manufacturing, and service-based.

In extremely poor and disconnected countries, such as Chad or South Sudan, individuals focus primarily on self-subsistence and farming, leading to a poor and isolated agrarian economy. 

Then there are countries like Vietnam and Taiwan that are manufacturing based. The economy is predominantly based around manufacturing goods and exporting them to other nations. This was how China became an economic powerhouse, and is still making up close to a third of their GDP.

The next, and generally richest (at least for the average person), economies of the world are service-based. These are countries like the USA and Australia, who buy their goods from manufacturing countries and focus themselves on carrying out services in industries such as healthcare, finance and software.

So the point of the above categorisations is to show that economies of countries such as the USA are positioned in a situation where they don't need to prioritise domestic manufacturing. If you live in a country like the USA, Canada, Australia or Great Britain, think about the jobs of you, your family, and your friends. You're likely fulfilling a service, where you've got both better pay and better working conditions than someone working in a manufacturing industry (and for good reason). 

The only problem that arises with service-based economies is how you deal with the poor and uneducated. No one wants to hire them. Using tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing is one way to do this, yet few experts would say it's the best, although it is faster. In the long term, the best bet is to invest in educating the poor and unskilled. Yet this needs to be done in a clearly tracked and unambiguous manner, as it can easily become excessively consuming in time and money.

In terms of tariffs, they have three benefits that show clearly, if you have researched his politics, why Trump is using them:

- They're a quick way to increase jobs.
- They foster self sufficiency.
- They wreck the economies of exporting manufacturers, such as China.",first recognise globalisation categorise economy say 3 category agrarian manufacture service base extremely poor disconnect country chad south sudan individual focus primarily self subsistence farm lead poor isolate agrarian economy country like vietnam taiwan manufacture base economy predominantly base around manufacture good export nation china become economic powerhouse still make close 3 gdp next generally rich less average person economy world service base country like usa australia buy good manufacture country focus carry service industry healthcare finance software point categorisation show economy country usa position situation don t need prioritise domestic manufacture live country like usa canada australia great britain think job family friend re likely fulfill service have get good pay good work condition someone work manufacture industry good reason problem arise service base economy deal poor uneducated one want hire use tariff encourage domestic manufacture one way yet expert say s good although fast long term good bet invest educate poor unskilled yet need do clearly track unambiguous manner can easily become excessively consume time money term tariff three benefit show clearly research politic trump use re quick way increase job foster self sufficiency wreck economy export manufacturer china,President Trump,29,positive,topic_2,Your Dark Creepy Back Yard

If you’re actually looking at trends over time, it impossible to say that the credit for anything good goes to Biden. For four years border crossing numbers surpassed records, every year. But then during his last 6 months, ironically coinciding with the election campaigns clearly showing that Biden stood no chance, and Trump making extremely direct statements of what would happen when he took office; the numbers took a nose dive. 

How am I the one moving the goalpost when you say the trends prove that Biden should have the credit, but then completely ignoring the massive anomaly in the trends that occurred during Biden and 100% due to Biden, the man that literally told migrants to “surge the border”. And that’s not even being hyperbolic, that is quite literally a quote from his mouth on public live TV.

Biden reinstating basic border control rules, which HE had cancelled for four years, breaks the 4 year anomaly that HE created and brings numbers back to the 20 year trend line. But that can not explain a drop from 61K in January, a number in line with pre-Biden trends; to 8K in February ! A record low since 2000, coinciding with a clear opposite rhetoric from Biden’s invitation to claim the border.

""Economic imbalances engendered political instability. Spain in the reigns of Charles V (1516 – 1556) and Philip II (1556 – 1598) was the strongest state in Europe. Like many other great powers, even to our own time, it fell into the fatal habit of deficit spending, and was finally reduced to a fiscal condition that historian J. A. Elliot describes as ""chronic bankruptcy."" At least six times between 1557 and 1647, the Spanish government went bankrupt, and found itself unable to meet its obligations or to borrow further. These fiscal crises occurred every 20 years with remarkable regularity – 1557, 1575, 1596, 1607, 1627, 1647. Spanish historian Vicens Vives writes: ""the vicious cycle was complete: the larger the state's debts became, the harder it was to meet them."" Other states were caught in the same cycle. Deficit financing was not invented in the 20th century. And England, France, and Germany, rulers became chronic debtors.

These instabilities were deepened by the effect of war. The two steepest surges of inflation in the 1540s and 1590s were periods of heavy military spending.

Newsom's problem is about the same as the Democrats as a whole.  In 2024 he was the best known alternative to Harris and what polling was done testing him against Trump was similar to Harris's numbers.  Harris was less visible than him actually and had better favorables to start, but that was because she was quiet most of Biden's presidency while Newsom had a recall, re-election, and got on TV a lot.  Her numbers were better the less she was known.  As she got known her numbers declined.

No other Democrats had enough name recognition to do a good test.  But we can safely assume that their unfavorables would go up once they got known and be similar to Harris or Newsom.

mgi5dij,Reddit,2025-03-07T16:06:19Z,"I don't think it's that simple. 

Or, rather, what counts as ""people oriented policies that benefit Americans"" is incredibly subjective and the very crux of the issue of how we win future elections. 

Obviously, most people reading this right now believe that Democratic policies benefit Americans far more than Trump's policies - myself included. 

But let's keep ourselves grounded in data.

[Let's look at voter turnout in 2024, first](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results,_2024:_Analysis_of_voter_turnout_in_the_2024_general_election). There's been a lot of noise that voter turnout was lower in 2024 than in 2020 - and that's very true. 63.7% vs 66.6%.

But to figure out what that means demographically (who stayed home, where, and why?), we have to dig deeper.

The average turnout in states that Trump won in the 2024 presidential election was 63.4%. This is down from 65.0% in 2020. Meanwhile, the average turnout in states Harris won was 66.4%, down from 70.1% that Biden won.

So both parties lost voters going from 2020 to 2024, but there's definitely a noticeable gap - Trump lost about 1.6% on average, and Harris lost 3.7% on average. 

More Democratic-leaning voters stayed home in 2024.

But that's also not the whole story, because we still need to understand where those voters lived to understand whether they swayed the election. Democratic voters staying home in California, for example, is basically meaningless. 

If we cut out the ""safe"" staunchly red and blue states, and look at the seven 2024 *battleground* states, they tell a very different story.

The average turnout in the seven battleground states was 70% in 2024, compared to 70.7% in 2020. Only a fraction of a percent drop - basically flat. People didn't stay home in the moderate battleground states, even if they did in safer, polarized districts. 

Arizona and North Carolina are outliers within that group, seeing a -5% and -2.5% drop in voter turnout, respectively. But Harris [lost Arizona by more than 5%](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/arizona/?r=0), and [by more than 2.5% in North Carolina](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/north-carolina/?r=0) - so even if we assume that every single voter who stayed home was Democratic-leaning (certainly not actually true), Harris still would have lost had they all come out to vote. 

The math is pretty compelling. In the moderate battleground states where the votes mattered, the election wasn't lost by Democrats staying home - it was lost by these moderate electorates lurching to the right and actively voting for Trump.

Democrats may have stayed home over Republicans by a couple % delta elsewhere in the country, but they did so almost entirely in districts that were already decided. 

We ultimately lost 2024 because the moderate middle actively chose Trump's policies over Democratic policies.  

We therefore have to ask ourselves why. 

It's not as simple as just saying that we need people focused policies if we seemingly don't know what the people deciding elections in moderate states actually want.",don t think s simple rather count people orient policy benefit american incredibly subjective crux issue win future election obviously people read right now believe democratic policy benefit american far trump s policy include let s keep ground datum let s look voter turnout 2024 first s lot noise voter turnout low 2024 2020 s true 63 7 vs 66 6 figure mean demographically stay home dig deep average turnout state trump win 2024 presidential election 63 4 65 0 2020 meanwhile average turnout state harris win 66 4 70 1 biden win party lose voter go 2020 2024 s definitely noticeable gap trump lose 1 6 average harris lose 3 7 average democratic lean voter stay home 2024 s also whole story still need understand voter live understand whether sway election democratic voter stay home california example basically meaningless cut safe staunchly red blue state look seven 2024 battleground state tell different story average turnout seven battleground state 70 2024 compare 70 7 2020 fraction percent drop basically flat people didn t stay home moderate battleground state even safe polarize district arizona north carolina outlier within group see 5 2 5 drop voter turnout respectively harris lose arizona 5 2 5 north carolina even assume every single voter stay home democratic lean certainly actually true harris still lose come vote math pretty compel moderate battleground state vote matter election wasn t lose democrat stay home lose moderate electorate lurch right actively vote trump democrat may stay home republican couple delta elsewhere country almost entirely district already decide ultimately lose 2024 moderate middle actively choose trump s policy democratic policy therefore ask s simple just say need people focus policy seemingly don t know people decide election moderate state actually want,Donald Trump,24,positive,topic_1,San Francisco

Can’t find a job? Outsourcing sent it overseas and immigrants took what’s left! Grocery prices too high? Too much government regulation! Wages too low? Taxes are too high! It plays well with his base, but it extends to average Americans too because Trump and his party control the narrative.

Democrats need a clear, bold vision with concise, simple messaging. And they likely need a brash, unconventional speaker to lead the charge on the campaign trail. If Democrats en masse TOMORROW endorse Medicare For All, public financing of elections, and/or the Green New Deal, or something along those lines, and they actually fought tooth and nail to make the pitch to the American people about how that would HELP them, I do believe it’d make them a force to be reckoned with.

Did Harris lose because of Biden? Or is Trump a singularly powerful politician who only lost in 2020 because of Covid and its consequences? Did people prefer Trump's policies, or did they not really pay any attention to what Harris was selling? I think there's data you can point to that backs up all of the above, and it's all just guesswork at this point.

The main thing, in my opinion, is that the party has to reckon with an unreasonable electorate. I'm not saying that Americans were smarter when they voted for Clinton or Reagan or JFK, but where do we even begin to make sense of the fact that people wanted cheaper stuff and ended up voting for a guy who threatened to put tariffs on most of our closest trade partners? Or that a lot of people seemed to want a more middle-of-the-road approach to reproductive rights but ended up backing the guy who killed Roe? I've heard people say Harris lost because she campaigned with Liz Cheney in (very few, small-ish) Wisconsin town hall-type events and that she was the queen of DEI who wanted open borders and socialized... everything? I don't think either of these ""she was too right/left-wing"" arguments explain how every place in the country except a few counties in GA and CO swung hard to the right. The party has to figure out why that happened, and most importantly, I think, if it was just a Trump phenomenon. But the issue is, I don't think there's data to answer these questions yet.

They are far more likely to have sensible positions on cultural issues, yet also be warriors for the working and middle class, because they have to actually manage a state government. Plus, if they had to win a tight race in a swing state, they can't talk in platitudes, adopt radical positions, or get nothing done. And, having been the top executive in a state helps voters see that person as a potential executive at the national level.

So, that means Shapiro, Whitmer, Besher, Polis, or Moore.

AOC can be a very effective messenger, but I don't see the country viewing her as Presidential material, Buttigieg is good in an interview or debate, but his resume is weak, and Warnock doesn't have much of anything to show for his tenure so far. Meanwhile, I've seen people mention Ro Khanna but I just don't see it at all. He has no gravitas, whereas Fetterman is just too odd and polarizing.

mgioqcw,Reddit,2025-03-07T17:57:52Z,"I'm breaking this next section off into a separate comment, because after looking at *where* we lost in terms of electoral college votes, now I'm going to dig a little deeper into the data behind *why*.

Up front, there's no doubt that ""the economy"" is the elephant in the room - [with roughly 40% of voters in the seven battleground states identifying it as their single most important consideration](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/votecast/). 

It would be easy to stop there and just chalk the loss up to unavoidable Covid inflation and move on, but I don't think that's right. 

When we look at more detailed breakdowns, it becomes clear that there's stark divisions along the lines of education, sex, and race. Across the battleground states (and nationally), we lost people with no college degree roughly 56% to 43%. We lost men 55% to 43%. We lost white people 56% to 42%. 

In other words, there's a noticeable, sharp trend where we lost blue collar white men - a statistic that dovetails with the *second place* issue articulated in the data: immigration, which was the top issue for about 20% of the electorate. Blue collar white men, who often work in low skill, manual labor roles, are most at risk in terms of economic pressure from immigration. 

While immigration may be a net positive for the country as a whole, there's also no denying that a glut of immigrant labor will put downward pressure on job opportunities and wages for this exact demographic of blue collar white men. So the two largest electoral issues for voters - the economy and immigration, at a combined 60% - are actually sort of intertwined for this cohort. The more immigrants there are competing for manual labor jobs, the worse the economy feels for this electoral group who depend on those same jobs. 

Personally, I think this is the true crux of what happened statistically. I think the Democratic party thought we had a lock on blue collar men because of the historical nature of union politics. But as our party's demographics shifted more heavily towards white collar, educated professionals (the NPR crowd - of which I'm one), we didn't fully realize that the NPR crowd's pro-immigration stance was actively at odds with the economic interests of those blue collar men. 

We were making a demographic *trade off* when we thought we were building a unified coalition. 

A trade off that ultimately lost us the election due to those blue collar white men being the deciding vote in the seven battleground states.",be break next section separate comment look lose term electoral college vote now be go dig little deep datum behind front s doubt economy elephant room roughly 40 voter seven battleground state identify single important consideration easy stop just chalk loss unavoidable covid inflation move don t think s right look detail breakdown become clear s stark division along line education sex race across battleground state nationally lose people college degree roughly 56 43 lose man 55 43 lose white people 56 42 word s noticeable sharp trend lose blue collar white man statistic dovetail 2 place issue articulate datum immigration top issue 20 electorate blue collar white man often work low skill manual labor role risk term economic pressure immigration immigration may net positive country whole s also deny glut immigrant labor put downward pressure job opportunity wage exact demographic blue collar white man two large electoral issue voter economy immigration combine 60 actually sort intertwine cohort immigrant compete manual labor job bad economy feel electoral group depend job personally think true crux happen statistically think democratic party think lock blue collar man historical nature union politic party s demographics shift heavily towards white collar educate professional npr crowd be one didn t fully realize npr crowd s pro immigration stance actively odd economic interest blue collar man make demographic trade think build unify coalition trade ultimately lose us election due blue collar white man decide vote seven battleground state,Donald Trump,-3,negative,topic_1,"Region of Altai, Russia"

This is a common idea, but I don't know that it shows up in the data.

I'd note that the demographic that wants the most ""substantial change"" is college-educated suburbanites - the Reddit demographic. Which is likely why we hear so much about it on this platform. But even among this cohort, we're talking about 78% that want ""small changes"" or ""no change,"" rather than the 80-85% in other demographics.

While I understand the history and the need for something like NATO, our militaries are far too advanced to continue instigating each other.

You can't operate in such as dogshit fashion and expect good results.

Too many Liberals on here think that Bernie being tied to ""socialism"" is the reason for his momentum but that's false. In reality, Bernie's populism and ""fuck the establishment"" mentality that Trump also shared was the real reason.

mgni0su,Reddit,2025-03-08T10:52:59Z,"Some of these comments are completely insane and show how out of touch a lot of people are. People don't understand the overall sentiment towards the Democratic party and what the actual majority of voters want to see happen. The far left 2% is not the majority. Yes, they're very vocal, but they constitute a tiny minority. 

People here are seriously thinking AOC stands a chance? Even if Trump's approval rating is at 20% in 2028, she'd lose badly. The attack ads against her practically will write themselves. She's been a target of the far right for years. No moderates will vote for her. New Jersey, Minnesota, and Virginia would be swing states. New Hampshire would flip red. It wouldn't matter who her opponent is. 

Same applies to Newsom. Voters just rejected a perceived ""liberal"" Californian. You think another one will somehow win? Sorry, but home state does matter. 

That's also why Wes Moore also would lose. Despite an impressive background, voters won't be able to relate to a liberal black Marylander. Sorry, but it's the truth. 

Pritzker also would lose badly, for mostly the same reasons. A Pritzker candidacy would make Dems look like hypocrites, considering he is wealthier than Trump. Also, when most people think of Illinois, they think of crime in Chicago. Case closed, unless he pulls off a landslide reelection in 2026 where he flips Trump +20 counties blue. 

Buttigieg is gay and is closely associated to the most unpopular Democratic president in modern history. Maybe in the far future he'll be viable, but at least a couple decades need to pass. 

Whitmer is a tier above all these candidates so far, but too many Americans won't vote for a female. She'd flip Michigan blue but possibly not any other states and not enough to win even if she did.

Warnock would flip Georgia, but moderate working class midwesterners will struggle to relate to him. I'm not sure he'd flip any other states.

Okay, now that I got that out of the way, let's talk about who actually could WIN.

  
Don't listen to the loons on the far left here- Shapiro is the strongest choice, by a significant margin. He's popular with 30% of Trump voters in Pennsylvania, a number that is probably starting to increase, if anything. No Pennsylvania pretty much means no presidency, now that Arizona has become a MAGA state (after almost a decade of clinging to its McCain neocon roots). He's not afraid to venture into deep red areas and talk with ordinary voters about their concerns. He has a positive working relationship with the 3 Republican statewide elected officeholders. Hell, David McCormick ran ads that highlighted his work with Shapiro, and he managed to win. Harris led the PA polls when Shapiro was the betting favorite to be VP, and Trump's campaign was genuinely afraid he'd be picked. Shapiro actually can fire up crowd and electrify a room when he does rallies. No other Democrat has that ability. Yeah okay, he sounds similar to Obama. So what? Does anyone actually think ordinary voters will prioritize THAT? Seriously? Also, it shouldn't and WOULDN'T matter to most voters that he's Jewish. A growing number of young voters, particularly males, think Democrats are the ones who are antisemitic. Shapiro would change that sentiment. Okay, he'd get crushed in Dearborn, Michigan. But he'd flip upwards of 20 other counties in the state blue. Because he actually APPEALS to moderate, rural, working class Obama x2 - Trump x3 voters. THOSE voters see him as reasonable and don't see him as condescending, unlike the other aforementioned Dems. And sorry, but those voters HEAVILY outnumber the far-left ""muh Palestine"" online trolls who will tell you otherwise. Those voters don't go on social media. I've spoken with MAGA people who agree with me. I've spoken to other MAGA people who have said that they've spoken to their politically like-minded friends who also agree with me. Shapiro would win, potentially by a landslide. He'd win Pennsylvania potentially by double digits, he'd easily flip Michigan and Wisconsin, and it's not impossibly that he'd be competitive in neighboring Ohio, considering the hell Trump will inflict on the state. Don't listen to uneducated dolts like Scott Presler who will try and gaslight you into believing that he's someone he's not or that he's somehow going to lose in 2026.",comment completely insane show touch lot people people don t understand overall sentiment towards democratic party actual majority voter want see happen far leave 2 majority yes re vocal constitute tiny minority people seriously think aoc stand chance even trump s approval rate 20 2028 have lose badly attack ad practically write s target far right year moderate vote new jersey minnesota virginia swing state new hampshire flip red wouldn t matter opponent apply newsom voter just reject perceive liberal californian think another one somehow win sorry home state matter s also wes moore also lose despite impressive background voter win t able relate liberal black marylander sorry s truth pritzker also lose badly mostly reason pritzker candidacy make dems look like hypocrite consider wealthy trump also people think illinois think crime chicago case close unless pull landslide reelection 2026 flip trump 20 county blue buttigieg gay closely associate unpopular democratic president modern history maybe far future will viable less couple decade need pass whitmer tier candidate far many american win t vote female have flip michigan blue possibly state enough win even warnock flip georgia moderate work class midwesterners struggle relate be sure have flip state okay now get way let s talk actually win don t listen loon far leave shapiro strong choice significant margin s popular 30 trump voter pennsylvania numb probably start increase anything pennsylvania pretty much mean presidency now arizona become maga state almost decade cling mccain neocon root s afraid venture deep red area talk ordinary voter concern positive work relationship 3 republican statewide elect officeholders hell david mccormick run ad highlight work shapiro manage win harris lead pa poll shapiro bet favorite vp trump s campaign genuinely afraid have pick shapiro actually can fire crowd electrify room rally democrat ability yes okay sound similar obama anyone actually think ordinary voter prioritize seriously also shouldn t wouldn t matter voter s jewish grow numb young voter particularly male think democrat one antisemitic shapiro change sentiment okay have get crush dearborn michigan have flip upwards 20 county state blue actually appeal moderate rural work class obama x2 trump x3 voter voter see reasonable don t see condescend unlike aforementioned dems sorry voter heavily outnumber far leave muh palestine online troll tell otherwise voter don t go social medium have speak maga people agree have speak maga people say have speak politically like mind friend also agree shapiro win potentially landslide have win pennsylvania potentially double digit have easily flip michigan wisconsin s impossibly have competitive neighbor ohio consider hell trump inflict state don t listen uneducated dolt like scott presler try gaslight believe s someone s s somehow go lose 2026,Donald Trump,35,positive,topic_1,"Phoenix, AZ"
mgni1bk,Reddit,2025-03-08T10:53:08Z,"Now for some others- I'm glad people are recognizing that Beshear would be a strong choice also. The ""radical liberal socialist"" smear would never stick on him, because it can easily be rebutted with ""Do you seriously think Kentucky would elect a Democrat like that?"" It's really hard to dislike Beshear. He comes across as neighborly, down-to-earth, and genuine. He would win, and would potentially make major inroads in the rural deep south, although not by anywhere close to enough to make those deep red states actually competitive. The issue for him is that he lacks name recognition, and he doesn't have that many accomplishments as governor because the Republican supermajorities in the legislature severely constrain him. 

Jeff Jackson is another candidate that's being tossed around. He also would potentially win. North Carolina Democrats are famously moderate, enough so that the party has remained remarkably resilient, not being in any danger of collapsing and going extinct like what's happened to Democrats in Alabama and Arkansas and the rest of the deep red south. Nor has their Democratic party gone extinct temporarily, only to revive themselves years later, like they've done in Georgia and Virginia. I've listened to Jackson speak and he'd have crossover appeal. 

I'm surprised people haven't mentioned Ruben Gallego, considering they've brought up Mark Kelly. Kelly has managed to win twice, and will very likely win again in 2028 because of his moderate reputation and the fact that he's a highly-regarded figure in his state. Cultural icons do well in places like Arizona. However, outran Harris by over 8 points because he has shown that he appeals to Latino males, a demographic that is drinking the MAGA kool-aid en masse. Probably because he is one himself and he's established himself as an immigration hawk who's at odds with much of his party. However, he's sort of lacking in the public speaking department.

Moore would be a strong candidate if he were governor of a swing state, not of deep blue Maryland. Looking at his tenure, I approve of some of his actions, but a lot of other things he's done (or hasn't tried to stop) would make him struggle to gain national appeal.

Pritzker would do even worse. No one will support an Illinois billionaire. The attack ads against him will write themselves. I like how he's been openly fighting Trump, but people associate Illinois with Chicago, and people associate big cities with high crime and homelessness. The end.

I have a few candidates that I am almost certain will run and that I think are legit :


Aoc
Walz
Crockett 
Whitmer 
Beshear 
Kamala 
Angela alsobrooks 
Amy klobuchar 


My dream ticket is a re run of Harris-Walz, but I'm not sure if we're gonna get that.  But don't forget, both Biden and Trump had 4 years off before running for president and winning.  I strongly believe the same could happen with Kamala.


If we don't get Harris-Walz, then the discussion opens up :


I love AOC, but she's really young and far left.


I love Walz.  


Crockett is absolutely filthy and loves to muck it up and play the game of chess


Whitmer is extremely popular in MI/WI, 2 absolute must win states.  She's a no nonsense candidate with a proven track record.  I think she would do well.


Beshear- more of a southern charm.  I see him as more of a VP.  I think you need more thump in president 


Angela alsobrooks- she's new.  She's from MD.  I love her.  She's a great speaker and she calls things like they are.  There's just something about her that I love.  


Amy klobuchar- she's more of a long shot but not impossible.


After Harris-Walz, my other dream ticket is alsobrooks/walz.  I'm telling you, I LOVE Angela alsobrooks.  I think voters would love her.


I think it all depends on what avenue the Dems want to attack Vance on.  Do they want to go progressive?  If so...AOC/walz or Whitmer.


Do they wanna do rust belt?  If so,  AOC/WALZ/WHITMER


Do you wanna go populist?  If so..Crockett/alsobrooks 


I think it depends on how democracy want to attack....alsobrooks would be a bit of a sleeper pick.  


Whitmer is more of a known quantity and would probably do well in WI/MI.  Aoc/walz would be more working class white voter.  But less play in south.  So you'd probably have to win PA or GA.

In my home country (USA) we elected a president once that touted his ultimate outsider status as a successful businessman who knows how the economy works because he has been playing in the high level economy games since forever. He made a promise that he would use this knowledge to make the economy better. In his first term he prioritized tax cuts for the rich. And now in his second term he is seemingly doing his best to continue his tariff experiment in fucking over normal Americans while at the same time creating carve outs for the ultra wealthy.

Knowing what the economy “should” do means something very different depending on who this politician is actually aiming to help.

mh1t5c2,Reddit,2025-03-10T19:56:22Z,"> “Improve the economy for who?” I think is a good summary question of what would make me distrustful of a man with his job history.

You can look at Carney’s history as Governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England. He helped navigate the financial crisis in Canada and warned those idiots in the UK against Brexit. 

> In my home country (USA) we elected a president once that touted his ultimate outsider status as a successful businessman who knows how the economy works because he has been playing in the high level economy games since forever. He made a promise that he would use this knowledge to make the economy better. In his first term he prioritized tax cuts for the rich. And now in his second term he is seemingly doing his best to continue his tariff experiment in fucking over normal Americans while at the same time creating carve outs for the ultra wealthy.

Your country elected a brain damaged, rapist wannabe dictator with dementia over a highly qualified and competent woman because of bigotry. You can’t compare Trump to Carney, Trump is literally a multiple time failed businessman who’s only in his position because he was born rich. Carney has held high level positions in two different countries, he knows how to work with government and he’s not a deranged liar like Trump. The two aren’t comparable.

> Knowing what the economy “should” do means something very different depending on who this politician is actually aiming to help.

The economy is very complicated and is often affected by multiple factors outside of someone’s control.

> I very much hope PM Carney actually does look out for the common Canadian. But I am saying as an America that I have seen a similar show play out, and the promises are much more attractive than the results in my experience.

Not sure how close you’re paying attention to Canadian politics but Carney’s main competition is a diet version of Trump that’s been in government his whole career and never passed a single bill. The guy literally has no substance, doesn’t have any substantive policy proposals and is a shameless moron. Think a more educated Majorie Taylor Green.

mhd63vc,Reddit,2025-03-12T14:07:24Z,"2028 could be one of the easiest elections for Democrats to sweep in. 
JD Vance is not a strong candidate and he could easily fall into the same trap Kamala Harris was in. 
1. An increasingly unpopular President 
2. Unable to break from Trumps policy 
3. Tied to an administration that by 2027/2028 will be overseeing another difficult period in American history 
It’s basically 2008 all over again 
Plus, he won’t be able to switch public opinion and become likable at the last hour like Harris did. 

With that being said 
The saying that Democrats only defeat themselves in elections is extremely true 

Harris wasn’t a bad candidate but she was not the person for this moment. 

But if she does to run in 2028, she needs to be EXTREMELY ready to take the Democratic Party down into the mud because that’s the only way to win. Tim Walz was not a good pick either. 

Newsom kind of exploded his chances with that interview with Charlie Kirk so he’s essentially written himself off. 

Whoever the choice needs to be
1. Extremely charismatic and personable 
2. Extremely outspoken and aggressive 
3. Not scared to play dirty and I’m taking like really dirty. 
4. No real ties to anyone named Clinton or Obama 
5. Knows how to work and win middle and lower income communities 

My best guess would be either Josh Shapiro (PA) and Gretchen Whitmer (MI) 

Both are governors of states that are going to be hit hard by Trumps tariffs, increased inflation and cuts to the federal government. Plus, you add a recession into the mix and try to tell the people of Michigan to vote republican again when their former popular governor is running. 

If Shapiro gets the nomination then Whitmer needs to be his VP, it would secure up the Midwest for them or at least give them an advantage. 

If Whitmer is the nominee, it becomes a little bit more tricky. Clinton did win the popular vote and Harris did out fundraise Trump so a woman can be a strong candidate. And by now, Democrats SHOULD know what’s coming their way by nominating a woman again. 
But this is where a strong VP candidate comes into play. 
She would HAVE to pick a young, charismatic “alpha male” type guy or else fall into the same trap Harris fell into with Walz. He wasn’t ready for the national spotlight and it dragged her down. Vance almost brought Trump down until the VP debate changed public opinion on Walz. So she needs to have a VP that can stand on their own and attract that male audience that Walz didn’t. 
It’s American politics, you got to play the game 

But if we were to elect our first woman President, I think she could do it, she is a combination of Hilary Clinton’s work ethic and Kamala Harris’s likability with both of their levels of experience. 

My best guess for a winning Democratic ticket is Shapiro - Whitmer. 

If it’s Whitmer, Ruben Gallego (AZ) gives you the Latino vote so that helps you in AZ, NV, GA & PA
Wes Moore helps you with the African American vote so that’s PA, MI, NC, & GA
Jon Ossoff helps you with younger voters and the south as well but has a more overall appeal 

But Democrats need to get their message cohesive, clear and start making getting it across NOW. 
Trump campaigned for basically 4 years & the republicans fell in line behind him.

mhe24yd,Reddit,2025-03-12T17:30:08Z,"I’m from Michigan. Big Gretch is widely hated by lots of Republicans…and yet she very easily wins each gubernatorial election in the state. She’s liberal enough for the liberals, and moderate enough for everyone else. Nationally, she’s extremely politically palatable. I see her campaigning as a VP at the very least. But seeing as she wasn’t on the last ticket as a VP…I think her eye is on the Presidential seat. 

I’m also Black. Unfortunately, 
We will never have a Black president again, because racism. Raphael Warnock, great man and public servant as he is, would not be successful on a ticket unless as a VP, with a white man on the Presidential ticket. And that’s just the reality.

Pete Buttigieg might have a chance as a VP, but I think he is less appealing to liberals and more appealing to moderates. I personally like his approach, often appearing as a guest on Fox, snarky and no nonsense when it’s required. He can give it as good as he gets it on Fox. This also means he could appeal to many conservative Republicans, however, they may take issue with his sexuality and views on LGBTQ+ issues. A recently extremely polarizing topic in politics and not what the Dems need right now. Their campaign needs to be focused on American issues not just American LGBTQ+ issues.

Josh Shapiro—it’s possible. But I don’t think he’s charismatic enough to really build a campaign for winning. I think out of everyone listed, he may be the most realistic—but they need to start grooming him for the ticket, like yesterday. 

I don’t know enough about Jared Polis to comment.

Wes Moore—unfortunately no for the same reasons as Warnock. Though Moore may be able to push his military service value especially for a VP race. But lately it seems veterans aren’t getting the kind of political clout they used to. 

AOC—the DNC would never. She’s hated in her own party for not being a doormat and not going along with all of the Dem morality politics and games of conceding to crazy requests from across the aisle. She’s also been labeled as too liberal by many moderates and traditional republicans. I think MAGA would have too easy of a time doing a smear campaign on her because of this—stoking irrational fears of trans kids using the “wrong” bathroom etc. you know, all their usual internalized phobias.

Americans have this delusion that this war was about NATO or that Russia wants peace, but the reality is the exact opposite. Putin is only interested in a peace that he can declare victory; even in these so-called negotiations, his demands have not changed and are nonnegotiable according to the Russians. This is an emerging threat, and if Putin wins, it means an emboldened imperialist Russia no different than a reimergent nazi Germany in the 1920s. Russia will only grow stronger and stronger; the preparation and rapid rearmament have already begun. It's just that right now, Russia is bogged down in Ukraine and losing if Western support continues. Seriously though, Russia is killing its troops that retreat as a matter of policy. It has committed many of the worst atrocities seen since WW2. Putin is threatening and terrorizing the US and the world with nuclear proliferation if we don't give him exactly what he wants. Seriously anyone with any doubt about the dangers of apeasement right now needs to wake up. The dumbest shit we could do is give in to russian demands. Right now we face the choice between peace and war that president Reagan talked about.

""There’s no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there’s only one guaranteed way. You can have peace and you can have it in the next second. Surrender. Admittedly, there’s a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement and this is the specter. Our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face that their policy of accommodation is appeasement and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender.

If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand, the ultimatum. And what? Then when Nikita Cruz, Jeff has told his people, he knows what our answer will be. He has told them that we are retreating under the pressure of the Cold War. And someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary because by that time, we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically.

He believes this because from our side, he’s heard voices pleading for peace at any price or better read than death, or as one commentator put it, he’d rather live on his knees than die on his feet. And therein lies the road to war because those voices don’t speak for the rest of us. You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace, so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery.""

Today, we are facing that Final ultimatum from a trashy dictator who wants to rebuild the Russian Empire. But the truth is, he doesnt have the cards and hes fucked the moment our support for Ukraine continues.

Currently, Russia is on the offensive, the elite of the Ukrainian forces have just been largely kicked out of Kursk. Manpower shortages are extreme. Equipment is lacking and Russians are getting close to the last fortified lines of defense. Ukraine would love to have a 30-day ceasefire just to mobilize more men, prepare more fortifications and get more military aid.

Russia knows this and doesn't want to agree to a break that would simply serve the Ukrainians to prepare for renewed fighting.

But Putin can't just say no, he wants ultimately normalization and getting on the good side of Trump is the best way to that. So instead of refusing, he says ""30 days of ceasefire but the Ukrainians stop mobilizing and training soldiers"", a demand which Ukraine is unlikely to accept.

So if Ukraine refuses Russia's conditions, it will blame Russia for the failure of the ceasefire, and Russia will blame Ukraine.",neither ukraine russia really interest ceasefire accept currently russia offensive elite ukrainian force just largely kick kursk manpower shortage extreme equipment lack russian get close last fortify line defense ukraine love 30 day ceasefire just mobilize man prepare fortification get military aid russia know doesn t want agree break simply serve ukrainian prepare renew fight putin can t just say want ultimately normalization get good side trump good way instead refuse say 30 day ceasefire ukrainian stop mobilize train soldier demand ukraine unlikely accept ukraine refuse russia s condition blame russia failure ceasefire russia blame ukraine,Donald Trump,-2,neutral,topic_2,"London, England"

mhoue7a,Reddit,2025-03-14T06:28:55Z,"I don't recall what he said, if you're referring to Putin at the beginning of the War, so I asked AI:

Me: Hey Hal, what was Putin's boast at the beginning of the current war in the Ukraine?

ChatGPT: Hey, pal. At the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, **Putin boasted that Ukraine would fall quickly**, with some reports indicating he and his inner circle expected Kyiv to be captured **within days** and the Ukrainian government to collapse.

# Key Boasts & Miscalculations:

1. **Ukraine Would Crumble Quickly** – Russian leadership reportedly believed Ukrainian forces would either surrender or be ineffective, underestimating both Ukraine’s military and public resistance.
2. **Kyiv Would Fall in 72 Hours** – U.S. and Western intelligence sources later revealed that Putin expected a quick ""decapitation strike"" to remove President Zelensky and install a puppet government.
3. **Ukrainians Would Welcome Russia as Liberators** – The Kremlin assumed significant pro-Russian sentiment, particularly in eastern Ukraine, would lead to easy occupation and limited resistance.
4. **The West Would Do Nothing** – Putin likely expected a weak Western response, based on previous reactions to Crimea (2014) and other aggressive Russian actions.
5. **Russia’s Military Superiority Would Overwhelm Ukraine** – Moscow’s public rhetoric implied that its military was vastly superior and that Ukrainian defenses would collapse in the face of a full invasion.

# What Actually Happened:

* Ukrainian forces, backed by Western intelligence and weapons, **held Kyiv** and forced Russia into a humiliating retreat from the north.
* The invasion **galvanized NATO**, rather than weakening it, leading to stronger military and economic support for Ukraine.
* Putin **misjudged both Ukraine’s will to fight and Russia’s own military readiness**, leading to massive Russian losses and an ongoing war.

On the defense she's almost unbeaten. But I can't think of a single offensive war that she has fought to what could rationally be called a successful conclusion. This is, it is my belief, because she is a much more culturally and ethnically diverse nation than she appears from the outside - and this is a problem. This means that the cultural and ethnic minorities do not really have (at least it appears) representation or advocacy in the government. You might think that wouldn't matter in a repressive regime like Putin's, but it is even more crucial. A group that does not feel represented does not feel beholden to the country they reside in. They go to fight because they are forced to, often under threat. This will not motivate an army to victory. Threat of destruction is the only motivator that will have success in an army that is built on this foundation.

mhoyjs9,Reddit,2025-03-14T06:57:32Z,"Oh I agree. I think Trump just places a ton of value on things like energy and mineral wealth in a way that is pretty dumb. Case in point the Ukraine mineral deal. The Ukrainians in reality do not have exceptional mineral wealth. It's worth maybe 10s of billions of dollars. It was a lot of political capital spent over nothing. Putin hopes Trump will vastly overestimate the value of Russian business. 

I think large-scale western investment is a bird that has flown. Yes business-men in the west would be happy to sell the Russians stuff and maybe speculate in Russian markets. However, no one is making hundreds of million dollar investments in Russia after all the confiscations that happen. The Russians probably couldn't afford to pay most of the people whose assets they seized the first time either. If the Russians want any big project in the future they're paying most of the capital costs or putting tons of collateral in a US bank account. No one is going to bet the house on stable US-Russian relations. 

The strategic issue I think is less actually trump opening up business with the Russians on the US end. It's the end of third parties caring even a little bit about sanctions.

mhs42gd,Reddit,2025-03-14T20:21:32Z,"Thanks for posting this, because I've really been on the fence about this issue. I'm trying to think about it in terms of what most benefits the people of the country, not the parties or politicians.

I certainly get the idea that the chaos the Trump administration has been inflicting on the economy has been disruptive and the opposition wants to help people by pushing back. I'm just not sure how voting against the C.R. accomplishes that. 

On inauguration day two months ago, if someone had told the Democrats that the country could still be operating on essentially Joe Biden's budget* eight months later — which is what the C.R. proposes to codify — they probably would have jumped at that offer. Now, it seems like most of them are against it for strategic reasons. But perhaps strategic reasons are enough to justify the fallout. 

There's an argument that the administration — specifically DOGE — will continue its [rampage through Federal agencies](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elon-musk-doge-government-shutdown.html) if the C.R. is passed, but it's not clear to me how those moves will be slowed or stopped by voting down the C.R.  Can someone explain how Democrats envision that happening? And isn't there a risk it could backfire, because a shutdown could lead to some programs being unrecoverable?

The Trump administration has [moved very quickly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2025/03/09/will-the-bureaucracy-and-its-allies-roll-back-the-trump-administrations-efficiency-drive/) and the mechanisms to check executive power have been slow to respond, but it seems to me they are finally responding. Just yesterday, a court [ordered reinstatement](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/hiring-retention/2025/03/federal-judge-orders-reinstatement-of-probationary-employees-targeted-by-mass-firings-at-most-agencies/) of all probationary Federal workers. [Courts have enjoined or reversed](https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/) many of the administration's other actions. Town halls in Republican districts have been full of angry constituents, to the point that the party has [stopped holding them.](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/04/house-republicans-town-halls-virtual) Bernie Sanders is [drawing huge crowds](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/drawing-huge-crowds-bernie-sanders-emerges-as-the-leader-of-the-anti-trump-resistance) for his anti-oligarchy tour of the country. 

Maybe I'm being overly optimistic about the ability of those kinds of things to keep this administration in check. But if the contention is that those means of pushback are insufficient to hinder the administration's most damaging moves, and provoking a shutdown is the only way, what happens next? After voting down the C.R., what's the envisioned plan that results in the people being better off?

\*EDIT: Per the [CRFB,](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-houses-full-year-continuing-resolution) ""The net result is a $10 billion increase in funding above FY 2024 levels and roughly flat total funding between the previous two CRs and this one.""

mhspr42,Reddit,2025-03-14T22:11:57Z,"The CR is not a continuation of Biden's budget. There are a number of cuts to non-defense discretionary spending and it contains provisions to let Trump decide whether or not he wants to spend appropriated money.

Voting no would be part of a fight to protect this spending and force Trump to spend the money appropriated by Congress.

 Here are some example cuts:

Department of Education: The CR mandates significant workforce reductions, resulting in nearly half of the Department's employees being laid off. This action is part of a broader initiative to downsize federal agencies. 

Army Corps of Engineers Projects: The bill proposes a 44% reduction in the construction budget for the Army Corps of Engineers, amounting to a $1.4 billion cut. This reduction places critical infrastructure projects, such as the expansion of the Houston Ship Channel and flood control systems around Houston, in jeopardy. 

Housing Assistance: The CR is expected to force the eviction of more than 32,000 households by reducing funding for housing assistance programs. 

Social Security Administration: The bill jeopardizes the operations of the Social Security Administration, potentially affecting the timely distribution of benefits. 

Infrastructure Investments: The CR proposes cuts to infrastructure investments, which could delay or halt planned projects aimed at improving transportation and public facilities. 

Nutrition Assistance: Funding reductions in the bill are likely to impact nutrition assistance programs, affecting food security for low-income families. 

Veterans' Medical Care: The resolution fails to include $22.8 billion in advanced funding for the Toxic Exposures Fund, which is essential for caring for veterans exposed to hazardous substances.

I have trudged through my follows on social media (academics and seasoned political journalists), and I was surprised that there is very little scholarly debate on this — only hot air aplenty in the comments, ofc. I get it, mulling over momentous decisions takes time, but that is a luxury we don't have when the current administration is acting like a bull in a China store.


I also doubt Musk/DOGE will relent either way.

All it takes is time.


Above all, I agree with Goldman's assessment in the AP report: (also linked to in main post)
“If the government shuts down with a Republican House, Republican Senate and Republican president, it will be solely because the Republicans have moved forward with a terrible, partisan, take-it-or-leave-it bill,” said Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y.


To summarize points made by both Schumer, AOC et al., by voting ""no"", the dissenting Democrats censure the GOP for not granting concessions in a bipartisan, negotiated budget bill, as the Dems have done for the Reps in all previous budget showdowns. Whatever comes next - gov. workers getting fired, immediate fallout from agency shutdowns, etc. — this administration and all its complicit lawmakers would solely bear the blame for all that, not the dissidents.

mht2672,Reddit,2025-03-14T23:13:21Z,"I would divide this into three separate claims

1. What are the likely short-term effects of US sanctions on Russia

It's more or less an open secret that the Russian Central Bank does not believe the war economy is sustainable much past the end of the year or the end of next year at best. Whether they can maneuver the economy to land in the economic doldrums or whether a major recession is coming is up for debate. The current situation is that the Russians face a 10.1% inflation rate despite slamming on the breaks with a massive 21% borrowing rate. The big worry for the CBR is that companies borrowing at 21% need to make a 21% return  in order not to take a loss on investment and yet they keep borrowing. This is realistically very hard to do without  raising prices substantially and so the ability of Russian monetary policy to continue to prevent inflation is very much in doubt. Worse is the potential that if the Russian economy enters a recession with tons of businesses having taken out loans that they can no longer cover it could cripple the Russian economy. So Russia must thread a needle. It's not secret that the underlying cause of Russia's economic woes is not market corrections but an inability to produce consumer goods and a shrinking labor supply due to emigration, casualties, and the high and unstable cost of smuggling western components. There are a variety of other problems like the lack of investment in long-term infrastructure due to war spending. The loss of the Western market etc etc. Without relief these problems will be at best bad and at worst recessionary relatively soon.

2. Why haven't US sanctions on Russia crippled the Russian economy quickly

First, while some industries e.g Natural Gas have been crippled in Russia the US and the West largely balked at crippling the Russian oil export market and past on the opportunity to truly force countries to choose between trading with Russia and the US. For this I blame Biden and Scholz although Trump is vastly worse than either than them in this regard. Still, oil is largely what the Russians needed for cash flow and without actually enforcing secondary sanctions on refiners who bought Russian oil the West largely balked on going for the jugular.

Second and more importantly sanctions rarely work quickly. The US has sanctioned Iran to death since the mid-2000s and now its economy has been basically collapsing since the late 2010s but sanctions while having significant short and medium term effect really kill economies slowly.

3. What are the long-term effects of US sanctions on Russia

The slow poison that Putin knows will destroy the Russian economy is that the new Russian autarkic economy largely produces substandard manufactured goods at inflated costs rather than having products that are actually competitive on export markets. Creating a temporary stimulus by building artillery shells is even less useful for the broader Russian economy. Moreover, the Russians without Western Finance are now almost wholly dependent on using oil revenues to provide liquidity to their industries meaning that there industries will be hyper sensitive to oil market shocks and face the inevitable imbalances of resource cursed countries. All of this is probably from a 20-30 year perspective fatal for a country. It lacks the capital to compete with the West on productivity gains, lacks the cheap labor supply to undercut prices from the third world, and lacks the market access to compete with either.

Now does this mean the Russian economy is likely to collapse in 1-2 years. Maybe to a limited extent although not necessarily. However, Russian decision-makers now that the deeper into a false autarkic economy it seeks that more disastrous the correction and that is not a trivial factor in Russia's considerations.",divide three separate claim 1 likely short term effect us sanction russia s little open secret russian central bank believe war economy sustainable much past end year end next year good whether can maneuver economy land economic doldrums whether major recession come debate current situation russian face 10 1 inflation rate despite slam break massive 21 borrow rate big worry cbr company borrow 21 need make 21 return order take loss investment yet keep borrow realistically hard without raise price substantially ability russian monetary policy continue prevent inflation much doubt bad potential russian economy enter recession ton business take loan can long cover cripple russian economy russia must thread needle s secret underlie cause russia s economic woe market correction inability produce consumer good shrink labor supply due emigration casualty high unstable cost smuggle western component variety problem like lack investment long term infrastructure due war spend loss western market etc etc without relief problem good bad bad recessionary relatively soon 2 haven t us sanction russia cripple russian economy quickly first industry e g natural gas cripple russia us west largely balk cripple russian oil export market past opportunity truly force country choose trade russia us blame biden scholz although trump vastly bad either regard still oil largely russian need cash flow without actually enforce secondary sanction refiner buy russian oil west largely balk go jugular 2 importantly sanction rarely work quickly us sanction iran death since mid 2000s now economy basically collapse since late 2010s sanction significant short medium term effect really kill economy slowly 3 long term effect us sanction russia slow poison putin know destroy russian economy new russian autarkic economy largely produce substandard manufacture good inflate cost rather product actually competitive export market create temporary stimulus build artillery shell even little useful broad russian economy moreover russian without western finance now almost wholly dependent use oil revenue provide liquidity industry mean industry hyper sensitive oil market shock face inevitable imbalance resource curse country probably 20 30 year perspective fatal country lack capital compete west productivity gain lack cheap labor supply undercut price 3 world lack market access compete either now mean russian economy likely collapse 1 2 year maybe limit extent although necessarily however russian decision maker now deep false autarkic economy seek disastrous correction trivial factor russia s consideration,Donald Trump,-46,negative,topic_2,wherever you are

Mark Carney also has the only economic experience to convince Trump of a better solution, while also reducing economic losses and increasing gains at quick rates. We really need someone who knows what they are doing and I just don't believe Pierre has what it takes. Well, Mark was the governor of the Bank of England and Canada and knows how to make business and Canada grow economically. He also wants to get the pipelines and infrastructure done quickly, but wants to be responsible about it. And I know conservatives have given him heat for that, but being responsible and environmentally friendly doesn't have to be a bad thing. Doing so may even give him more leverage with those provinces that had been previously hesitant. These are all genuinely important points to consider. I believe based on all the facts Mark Carney is the best person for the job. That being said, the best person for the job doesn’t always win. It's definitely leaning conservative, but even conservatives can see Mark's experience might be what really counts right now.  Pierres pokes at Mark for investing globally and also being one of multiple advisors to Trudeau is a bit of a weak argument given his own lack of experience economically. And then there's Elon Musk who is funding Pierre and Trump who supports him. I'm guessing that's not for the right reasons. Pierre has even gone as far as taking Trumps talking points in speeches.

One day the ordeal of being the President of the United States and all the obligations and duties it entails really got to Donald Trump. He was dealing with low poll numbers, other members of the government weren't too happy with him, and even his friends and family were distant. So he decided to seek counsel from previous American presidents who were truly great so he could copy them.

With this in mind, he first went to the Washington monument and asked George Washington for advice. Washington replied ""Trump, you should always be honest and tell the truth."" 

That wasn't entirely pleasing to Trump so next he went to the Jefferson Memorial and asked Thomas Jefferson for insight. Jefferson replied back ""Trump, it's important to maintain human rights and follow the constitution."" 

Here again, this wasn't exactly what Trump was looking for so he headed to the Lincoln Memoral next. For the third and final attempt, he sought wisdom from Abraham Lincoln. He explained that he already consulted with Washington and Jefferson but they were of little help and he really needed a lot of assistance here.  This time Lincoln paused for a little bit and replied ""Trump, I honestly think the best thing you can do is go see a play.""",joke good one day ordeal president unite state obligation duty entail really get donald trump deal low poll number member government weren t happy even friend family distant decide seek counsel previous american president truly great copy mind first go washington monument ask george washington advice washington reply trump always honest tell truth wasn t entirely please trump next go jefferson memorial ask thomas jefferson insight jefferson reply back trump s important maintain human right follow constitution wasn t exactly trump look head lincoln memoral next 3 final attempt seek wisdom abraham lincoln explain already consult washington jefferson little help really need lot assistance time lincoln pause little bite reply trump honestly think good thing can go see play,Donald Trump,21,neutral,topic_1,"Kyalami, South Africa"

Typically, a “clean” continuing resolution would just hold current government spending levels steady, providing for more time for the full appropriations process to continue. However, H.R. 1968 would also make changes to current spending levels, with an increase in defense spending of $6 billion, and $13 billion in cuts to domestic spending. The bill also includes provisions that would give the Trump administration significantly more leeway to spend federal dollars without Congressional approval. It also includes a provision that would prevent any member of Congress from attempting to terminate President Trump’s recent declaration of national emergencies over immigration and the U.S. border, which he has used to impose large, broad-based tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China.

mhus8fr,Reddit,2025-03-15T04:49:54Z,"First of all, thank you for providing a real answer. 

Regarding the first point, I can certainly understand that strategy, though I don't happen to agree with it. In fact, I think the opposition's automatic resistance to everything Trump proposes (""even if it's nominally in our interest too"") is a big part of why he got re-elected. Still, I appreciate that some people see it differently.

To break down the ""devious bullshit""...

> an increase in defense spending of $6 billion, and $13 billion in cuts to domestic spending. 

Summed together, those represent 0.1% of [total expenditures.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_federal_budget) That hardly seems like a reason to shut down the government.

> The bill also includes provisions that would give the Trump administration significantly more leeway to spend federal dollars without Congressional approval.

He seems to be doing that anyway, and arguably would under a shutdown too, by declaring for himself which expenditures are ""essential.""

> It also includes a provision that would prevent any member of Congress from attempting to terminate President Trump’s recent declaration of national emergencies over immigration and the U.S. border, which he has used to impose large, broad-based tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China.

Now *this* seems like a solid reason to vote against the CR, but I wonder if they have the votes to do that anyway. Is it just a symbolic power at this point, one that would be restored if Democrats regained the majority?

Our FPTP voting system ensures there will be a party duopoly, and you don't get to play the game if your not on one of the teams on the field.  
You MUST make compromise, and cooperate with the party apparatus. Politics is a game about power, and the party wields power over its constituents.

If you want to stomp your feet, and buck the system too much, you will be ostracized.

Everyone knows politicians are scheming. Its WHAT  they do.  They are playing power games, CONSTANTLY.  You don't think this extends beyond the two teams, and internally? To deny that is to to either be intentionally naive, or acting in bad faith.  

You don't raise 2 billion dollars for a political campaign and not incur debts.  People, and corporations especially don't just throw away money.  They invest it.  They invest it in equities, and they invest it in politicians for favorable legislation.  
Most bills aren't written by politicians. They are written by lobbyists.  Like a politician has time between endless campaigns, and show votes to write legislation.  

This system is captured by capital. It does not serve your interests, beyond pandering to you every four years for your vote.  It never has.

mhwkcp1,Reddit,2025-03-15T14:17:33Z,"> Judging by the swiftness and scale of the illegal impoundments, it is bold of Schumer or Carville to presume there's much gov. left to save by that point.

There are two prongs of the Trump-Musk campaign to destroy the federal government: impoundments and firings. (Leaving Trump's and Musk's other misdeeds aside for the moment.)

Impoundments basically cannot be stopped. The USAID plaintiffs got [temporarily lucky](https://www.democracynow.org/2025/3/6/usaid_supreme_court_foreign_aid_frozen) because the Supreme Court, with Roberts and Coney Barrett bucking Trump, found that Trump was moving too quickly to the point of maliciousness. But ordinarily, the government cancels things as they like, as long as they claim they've resolved back payments and closed out each case. So the likely outcome of the USAID case is that DOGE will cancel things one by one and fight thousands of individual lawsuits over unpaid bills. They are currently able to pretend that they can do this -- in six months, the backlog will probably cause chaos at the DOJ. ([Full analysis here](https://soundcloud.com/alabpodcast/episode-31-doj-and-doge)) 

Firings *can* be slowed. Trump was claiming he can rule poor performance by anyone on probation and lay them off. Again, [judges ruled](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/13/nx-s1-5325694/maryland-court-fired-federal-employees-trump) he can't just unilaterally say everyone was a poor performer. The civil servants might feel anxious and scared right now, but they are on firmer ground than the contractors. It will be a battle to keep the probationary employees fired and even harder to fire the non-probationary employees. 

But what if the government shuts down? The Trump camp argues that after 30 days, all furloughed employees could be considered fired. That's a ridiculous claim, but Trump could use the shutdown to [shut down the agency that rules on the validity of such claims](https://www.wakeuptopolitics.com/p/how-a-shutdown-could-empower-trump). Then Trump could *veto* new spending bills and operate the country in a permanent state of emergency.

My opinion: Schumer was right. Trump's popularity will continue to sag as the true extent of what he has done becomes clear. Trump is itching for an excuse right now to become a full-on dictator. That fight should happen in 6 months when he is universally hated. AOC is using anger over Dem unpreparedness to campaign for Senate, and [Schumer knows it](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/schumer-trump-government-shutdown.html?searchResultPosition=6), but he's not fighting back because [he knows the next generation belongs to her](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/us/politics/schumer-impeachment-new-york.html?searchResultPosition=4).",judge swiftness scale illegal impoundment bold schumer carville presume s much gov leave save point two prong trump musk campaign destroy federal government impoundment firing leave trump s musk s misdeed aside moment impoundment basically stop usaid plaintiff get temporarily lucky supreme court roberts coney barrett buck trump find trump move quickly point maliciousness ordinarily government cancel thing like long claim have resolve back payment close case likely outcome usaid case doge cancel thing one one fight thousand individual lawsuit unpaid bill currently able pretend can six month backlog probably cause chaos doj full analysis firing can slow trump claim can rule poor performance anyone probation lie judge rule can t just unilaterally say everyone poor performer civil servant may feel anxious scare right now firm grind contractor battle keep probationary employee fire even hard fire non probationary employee government shut trump camp argue 30 day furloughed employee consider fire s ridiculous claim trump use shutdown shut agency rule validity claim trump veto new spend bill operate country permanent state emergency opinion schumer right trump s popularity continue sag true extent do become clear trump itch excuse right now become full dictator fight happen 6 month universally hate aoc use anger dem unpreparedness campaign senate schumer know s fight back know next generation belong,President Trump,-37,positive,topic_2,Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

>So resisting is pointless? If a bill comes before them to ban abortion can I trust you'll advise Schumer to wip 7 votes for it? Get out of his way, ride the train all the way to the station!

Pick your battles. Trump won the election at the end of the day and campaigned on doing exactly this. If Democrats are going to win back the 50,000 swing voters in 7 states that decided the election, it will only happen when they feel pain in more than their 401K's and realise the GOP policy positions they've been supporting all this time are nonsense.

As you should have learned in the recent elections, the economy matters more than abortion, same-sex marriage, or any of the other issues you list. The whole theory of Kamala's candidacy was she was a better representative on the subject of abortion rights and this was supposed to be the killer issue. Guess what, she was, but it didn't matter anyway.

Trump will try and stay in power. That's when you act. This CR is a pointless fight with no upside at all and will rightly be portrayed as the Dems standing in the way of the agenda Trump campaigned on, and any ill effects from DOGE/Trump will then be portrayed correctly as the Democrat's fault.

Also, and this is important, pick a stance. Either shutdowns matter or they don't. This shutdown would be world ending for dems but also no shutdown has ever mattered and people forget about them easily? Right. Square that circle.

Okay cool I trust the billionaire to know the first thing about politics because why? And also they in fact, not, blame dems every single time. Point of fact is that the blame is almost always to the GOP. At least since Bush 2.

Because democratic leadership is full of dipshits who don't FIGHT. They run to the gop framing of issues and lose. The GOP isn't good at it the dems just fight with two hands behind their back.

[Per AOC](https://bsky.app/profile/aoc.bsky.social/post/3lkeqn7u7u22c), there was an ""agreed-upon plan"" that Schumer broke. If I'm guessing, based on reporting, is what happened here is:

1. Schumer thinks ""There's no way House Republicans can pass a CR with only one defection, so if House Democrats all vote no that it'll fail and we can blame the Republicans.""
2. Some House Democrats are like ""I'm in a swing district and this is a tough vote for me. What happens if they do pass it?""
3. Schumer tells them that if it passes in the House, Senate Democrats will block it and stand united, but he doesn't expect to be called on it.
4. House Republicans manage to pass a CR with only one defection. Schumer's like ""Fuck"".
5. Schumer flip-flops at the last second. House Democrats are legitimately shocked and outraged, to the point that centrists Democrats are giving AOC money to run a primary challenge against Schumer (that'd be in 2028)

I think any country afraid of NATO is like an American afraid of ""radical liberals"".  They're already clearly the bad guy.

I'm not sure what you're saying here.  Are you suggesting that Russia has more bodies to throw away long-term?  Perhaps.  But I'm not sure this is Ukraine ""being sacrificed for NATO"" as much as Ukraine not yet getting a reasonable ceasefire offer.  

I'm struggling to get good straight figures on Ukraine and Russia economically speaking.  Ukraine took a 30% drop in GDP.  Russia's GDP is normalized if you include their war spending (so long as the government can maintain over $300B/yr in military expenses, about 15% of its GDP), but industry in general is apparently down; in 2023, over 40% of businesses in russia reported severe worker shortages.

I'm writing this at the end and moving it to the top.  I suspect I might come off like a jerk, so hopefully this softens any of that instead of making you hyper aware of looking for it.  I have some kind of personality flaw that stops me from thinking non-confrontationally.  

>The current situation is that the Russians face a 10.1% inflation rate despite slamming on the breaks with a massive 21% borrowing rate. 

The US is at 2.8% and about 8%.  So we are definitely more profitable, as a banking sector.  But the 21/10.1 spread is still well enough for their banks to make money, and have room to refinance customers down when soldier bonuses end and there's less money churning around with no one to spend it.  

>very hard to do without raising prices substantially and so the ability of Russian monetary policy to continue to prevent inflation is very much in doubt.

This is probably some genuine issue on my part.  If they have 10.1% inflation, how is their inability to prevent inflation not already apparent?  

>It's not secret that the underlying cause of Russia's economic woes is not market corrections but an inability to produce consumer goods and a shrinking labor supply due to emigration, casualties, and the high and unstable cost of smuggling western components. There are a variety of other problems like the lack of investment in long-term infrastructure due to war spending.

This I wholeheartedly agree with.  On the one hand it's the present costs of the war.  And on the other call them the present-future costs, because of the loss of investment in better endeavors.  

On a long enough time line, that's definitely extinction.  But winning a war can bounce back pretty substantially from all those costs.  Especially here, where they are handing locally substantial sums of money to lower middle class men to go fight the war.  When they come back they're going to get married and have a nest egg to start out with.  They'll have bargaining power to look for employment that could be a career.  Groups of these men will have money to start businesses.  

>some industries e.g Natural Gas have been crippled in Russia 

Crippled is an interesting word.  The recent information is nebulous, at least this seems okay for the lead up to the war:

https://www.statista.com/statistics/265335/natural-gas-production-in-russia-since-1998/

For 2024 I can't find a source other than the Russian government.  I won't bother linking anything, not like it really matters.  They say 685 billion cubic meters.  I think that means if it is crippled, they are lying, like ridiculously.  The trend kept going down and it's actually in the mid 500's or something.  

>the West largely balked at crippling the Russian oil export market and past on the opportunity to truly force countries to choose between trading with Russia and the US.

This is a great point.  There were military commitments we were not going to make and financial ones along side them.  I admit to having limited my thinking to ""other than the red lines we drew for ourselves.""  Though that is also a slight argument, in that I think this was straightforward self interest.  The global oil market is a finicky beast that we need humming for life to go right.  I suspect it's similar with some aspects of the European economy (specifically I think we might have chemical industries that worked out niche specializations out of the expectation of being able to trade freely).  

>The US has sanctioned Iran to death since the mid-2000s and now its economy has been basically collapsing since the late 2010s but sanctions while having significant short and medium term effect really kill economies slowly.

Heck yeah, now do Cuba.  That's a flat out embargo that's riding wheels that might take it through a century.    

If I tried to tell people we should just stop messing with Cuba, do you think I'd be called a Castro sympathizer or something?  By the by, I know that Miguel Díaz-Canel is the president of Cuba.  That doesn't change what I'd expect to be called.  

>The slow poison that Putin knows will destroy the Russian economy is that the new Russian autarkic economy largely produces substandard manufactured goods at inflated costs rather than having products that are actually competitive on export markets.

I don't know man.  It seems like such are the ravages of a second world economy.  Obviously historical precedent is clear: that can't last for more than several decades.  But the problems might easily clear up after the war.  

The US was able to keep the ""embargo"" against Iraq up after 1991.  I used the quotes because the term isn't accurate and I couldn't think of a better one.  And as you said, a similar kind of situation, though less severe, has been going on with Iran for a long time.

mi0a7lj,Reddit,2025-03-16T03:05:48Z,"No, based on the House Democrats' reaction they genuinely did not expect this one to go the way it did. The problem was as follows, they could:

1.  Pass the CR, and ensure the government is funded through September 30th. However, doing this funds DOGE and DHS' deportation programs, which are both hot button issues for Progressive voters that Democrats would really like to have turn out for several off-year elections this year (like the Wisconsin Supreme Court seat that will tip the balance of redistricting in the state). Or,

2. Block cloture in the Senate, and induce a shutdown. In other administrations this may have worked, **however**, those administrations did not have Russ Vought as the OMB Director. Russ Vought curiously enough is the author of the parts of Project 2025 that discussed both how to reduce the size of government and then how to ensure it doesn't grow back. Based on the House's recess schedule, a shutdown would have meant Vought would have had at least a 12 day Demolition Derby to lay off staff and shutter departments. Likewise, the DOGE staff could have been declared ""essential"" by the OMB director and kept on their current tasks (though waiting for pay until after the shutdown). Same for DHS/ICE.

So behind door number 1 you have annoyed progressive voters and continued DOGE work, and continued Deportations, and behind door number 2 you have annoyed progressive voters, continued DOGE work, continued Deportations, and a nearly two week metaphorical killdozer rampage through the executive branch on top of all of that.

The scale and speed at which Trump is consuming the power of the legislative branch is orders of magnitude higher than any president before him, in a way that is actually staggering.

To speak in purely numerical terms, Obama signed 277 executive orders during his 8 years in office. An average of 2 per month. In Biden's four years, he signed 162, an average of 4 a month. Trump has signed 89 in under two months.

Unlike pausing student loan debts, a huge portion of these actions are made with the explicit intention that they will be impossible to reverse even after they are found unconstitutional by courts. Also, the Trump administration is signaling that they may not abide by court decisions they don't like.

OP’s point is that Trump could be testing the foundation and the durability of American government. And this sort of makes sense, considering laws were changed so he could be prosecuted for something he otherwise wouldn’t have been. If he can pass and do all sorts of crazy stuff, he’s exposing that the system is already broken, not that HE broke it. Meaning, anyone can do what he’s doing. 

If court orders are being ignored, other parts or branches of the government should be acting to combat that. If they’re not, this proves again that the system is already broken (by the ppl currently working in the government and/or the government structure itself) and our system doesn’t actually hold up when truly challenged. A system that only works when everyone follows the longstanding rules is not a real system. 

If a president is elected and does things that are against the law, it should be very easy to get them out.

mi46l8r,Reddit,2025-03-16T20:09:04Z,"Politicians have always treated it like guidelines. The only difference is trump isn't hiding he's attacking it. 

When oboma took down occupy Wallstreet, he didn't say there was limits to speech, he accused them of violence but stressed peaceful protest was ok. 

When Bush Jr got the patriot act, he said you have a 4th amendment right, he was just going after ""terrorists"" . 

When biden went after gaza orotestors with the goon squad, he did stress nonviolent prptest was ok. Sure the goonsquad ignored that. But the perception was only violent ones were shut down. 

Same with other draconian pandemic decisions by governors during the pandemic. Limiting the right to assembly or freedom of movement or government medical decisions was to protect and as soon as the pandemic calmed down they'd end. 

It was at least portrayed as something else. 

Trunp flat out says protesting genocide in Gaza is supporting terrorism and is a danger to the country.  So the goonsquad shows up, but it doesn't pretend. 

Trunp just fires people who won't take the knee right away, instead of winning them over or slowly replacing them. 

Trump has the raids claiming fir border safety and acting like the 4th amendment diesnt exist for noncitizens. Bidens guys at least got warrants, so did oboma. Even though the end result is the same.

Mitch spent *DECADES* using government shutdowns to put public pressure on the majority. One might say, “well, the dems should have done that!”, but that misses the point that Trump is **NOT** a president. He is a dictator in training. If the government shut down, the ensuing chaos would literally hand over complete control to Trump’s regime. 

DOGE already has access to the payment systems, so they don’t need any in-house personnel. The courts are putting up the stiffest resistance to the regime, and in the event of a shutdown their dockets would grind to a halt within a few weeks. The few “good eggs” still rolling around in the federal government would be sent home until the shutdown is resolved. Shutting down would give the Trump regime everything they need (and the perfect excuse) to remove the last few remaining safeguards against tyranny. I can *very* easily see a narrative forming along the lines of “After we shut the government down, we realized that 75+% of the federal workforce is un-needed. They will not be returning to their posts.”

And, not for nothing, the narrative had already been laid out in right wing propaganda that “Chuck shut the government down.” It’s completely backwards and incorrect, but I legitimately heard this from a person in meatspace.

I am currently working on transitioning my career to work from home so that I will not be immediately alienated from income if I choose to leave at a moment's notice. If you're like me and English monolingual then [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population) can be useful. You want somewhere with high English speakers per capita.

UK is my top choice currently because I have some family there and might be able to get a long term work or student visa. Most European countries have a good English speaker rate and high standard of living but can be hard to get into. Unfortunately most places on Earth you also have to take the way you look and the relative danger into account. There are a lot of places that are decently safe and have low cost of living but I don't trust crime rate figures alone because they don't factor in the fact that you can be a target if you don't look like a native. Gender and sexuality of course play a role as well. If you are not straight or a woman you might want to avoid the Middle East. Singapore is the best destination in Asia for English speakers but Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong are good places to live if you can deal with the language barrier. Thailand as well I think? Haven't looked into it yet. The Philippines appeals to me for its high rate of English speakers but I have been explicitly told by Filipinos that I could be a target for crime for not looking like a native. Australia and New Zealand have basically the same analysis as Europe, and the Spanish-speaking world has a lot of good options if you can get past that language barrier.

Your family status is huge because it can be hard to get permanent residence for everyone, but at the same time with a married couple often one working domestically is enough to get long term residence for both. If you intend to take your pets you might be required to send them through quarantine.

Also consider places where locals will actually want you. I wouldn't consider this a dispositive factor but you want to be able to get along with people. It's not good to contribute to existing housing crises but at the same time there is a scarcity of housing almost everywhere it's nice to live, and a scarcity of safe, quality housing everywhere else.

The democrats would have been blamed for the shutdown, and the public would have been right to blame them for it. 

You had progressives going on TV every day advocating for a shutdown unless Republicans agreed to put in language that stops DOGE and other parts of the Trump agenda. This is a good goal to have, but the politics wouldn't have worked. 

For one, saying you are saving federal workers' jobs by shutting down the government is hypocritical immediately to anyone who hears it. 

Second, stopping DOGE isn't popular enough to get over the stink of a government shutdown. DOGE isn't trumps most popular initiative, but it still polls in the mid to high 40s and even the low 50s with the public when you don't mention Elon directly. There just isn't enough outrage over the subject to make drastic action popular. 

Third, and most importantly, there are dozens if not hundreds of clips of prominent Democrats illustrating why government shutdowns are never a good idea and don't help anything.

Simply, there was no way for Democrats to not lose the publicity war on this one. They would be forced to end the shutdown in a week and look like fools. There were also already number of senate democrats willing to break ranks already, so it's entirely possible that if Schumer whipped the votes against the bill, they would have made it a very uncomfortable vote, and would have then been on TV trashing the shutdown with some very notable names being very against the shutdown publicly,  which would make the rest of the democrats look bad.

There is a reason to shut the government down, which is to end the destruction of government agencies by forcing an enforcement mechanism for making sure the legally allocated money is spent where it is legally allocated. The purpose of the budget is making sure specific things are funded, not giving the president money for whatever he wants. The ""CR"" was fast closer to the second description than any budget ever put forward. The reason to shut the government down is to preserve the parts of the government you want funded. 

The argument against letting the government shut down is that Musk would be able to accomplish far more destruction with the government closed and having less oversight over him. That is questionable and can't be known, but is likely accelerating both the destruction of the government as well as the discontent amongst the populace. Concern over what the government shutdown looks like is understandable. I personally wanted the shutdown, but I'm not demanding it. 

What i did want was some kind of leadership and evidence that they had a plan. I wish they had told Republicans to get rid of the filibuster if they wanted to pass a bill that has zero Democratic input because it would get zero Democratic votes.

micr7h5,Reddit,2025-03-18T03:07:21Z,"I think Schumer and Fetterman should’ve explained it better but they really had no choice. 

I hate the CR and think it’s an abomination. But those arguing that Democrats should have forced a government shutdown to “hold Trump accountable,” are missing the terrifying reality of what would have actually happened. 

First and foremost the Courts would’ve shut down within a couple of weeks when they ran out of money. So keep that in mind as we consider the rest. 

Trump isn’t a normal politician, he’s an authoritarian and wants more power. This would’ve given him cover to declare a national emergency. 

Under the National Emergencies Act, Trump could have redirected Medicaid or Snap funds to ICE or military operations, suspended civil liberties, and fired tens of thousands of federal workers, with no ability to challenge any of it in court. It would let him finish the project Musk began but it would’ve been turbo charged.  He and Musk and Vought would have purged the federal bureaucracy and installed loyalists in key agencies. All of it could’ve been done under the guise of “National Security”.

Trump would have selectively funded what he decided were “essential services” like ICE, Border Patrol, and the military while starving out the other agencies that might have slowed him down or he doesn’t like. And without the courts, he would’ve effectively created a militarized state while crushing any legal resistance. He could choose to pay only certain officers who would still be required to work during a Shutdown, making them loyal to him.  

The other key part of the plan would be blaming Democrats. The GOP media machine would be blaming Democrats for the chaos, radicalizing the MAGA base, and convincing the public that only he could restore order, which would actually be true. This is literally how Putin consolidated power in Russia and how Erdogan dismantled democracy in Turkey. During the COVID pandemic, Viktor Orbán used the opposition’s refusal to agree to the pandemic measures he proposed as an excuse to seize power and shifted funds from hospitals and social programs to private police forces and border patrol units.

As the shutdown continued for months (and it would have) he could claim, “The country is too unstable for elections,” delaying the 2026 midterms or even refusing to leave office in 2028. This was the GOP’s real plan. That’s why McConnell and House Republicans quietly supported the CR, which they normally hate. Musk & Trump were hoping Democrats would fall into the trap and force the shutdown, giving Trump the excuse he needed to seize authoritarian power and flip the narrative.

Schumer and the others didn’t “cave” by keeping the government funded. They took the least bad option and bought us time. It stopped Trump from pulling the trigger for now but he will find another moment and it won’t be long.

We need Trump’s popularity to continue bottoming out and right now he is getting all the blame for everything. But the media would have dropped that and started both sidesing every job loss and negative story about the economy the minute Dems made their votes official. And not just the job losses. The economy tanking, consumer confidence… Everything would have been been framed as being the Dems fault too. That cannot be allowed to happen..we need this outrage to keep building and in only one direction.

We need his approval in the 30s. We need members of Congress worried about getting shouted out of Grocery Stores, never mind Town Halls.

It’s much much harder to cancel elections with a 33% approval after sending the economy into recession, when he won’t have the backing of the corporate elites or normies in Red States, than it is when you’re at 45% and CEOs are only warning about a potential recession, and only on deep background. That’s not a country ready to stand up to Donald Trump.

micw34v,Reddit,2025-03-18T03:34:35Z,"To be clear - neither solution is good. But something to keep in mind, is that if the government is not funded, we're talking millions of people are not getting paid - not just federal employees but also a lot of private businesses and contracts that the government pays. We're talking LOTS of very unhappy people. Even in that situation, the president gets unilateral control in determining which federal employees MUST work - but even that situation is pretty awful because all federal employees are given backpay when the government is funded, so imagine being the person that has to work without pay for an undetermined amount of time. Morale is incredibly low and when rent comes due, you still need to figure something out. 

I think Democrats concocted in their minds, that during this scenario that Trump/Musk could just keep things closed for as long as they want while they just slash and burn but i don't think they really thought about how much public pressure and outrage would be growing on Trump and Musk during this time. Funding  the government allows the downward spiral to continue; i don't see a reality where Trump suddenly becomes more popular - he'll just continue to bleed support. Not funding the government would have been a pretty sudden and immediate support freefall. 

My only thought about what Democratic politicians were thinking, is the larger thought around a leader of a war torn country whose about lose power and you risk a power vacuum. You try to insulate the leader and control externalities so that when the collapse does come, you can control partially who ends up on top.

I don't think they actually had any leverage. The dems were put in a corner by the republicans and they only had two options. 

>He was afraid he would get blamed for the shutdown

That's the correct way of thinking because the Republicans insured that the democrats would have been responsible for a shutdown. 

The House passed it and left town meaning the issue would have to be decided by the Senate. There was no option of sending something back to the House. Cleary Johnson and Thune worked this out. The options for the Senate dems then consisted of voting for cloture or not. If not, the dems would be responsible for the legislation dying. The dems would have been responsible for the shutdown. 

Once shutdown what leverage would the dems have had? Especially when it would have been the ""Schumer shutdown."" The Republicans would have had even more leverage in this situation. The Republican base is more amenable to a shutdown. The right would have continued to blame democrats and left the government shutdown until the Democrats came to the table.

I think Schumer simply made the best of a bad situation.",give democrat leverage nothing don t think actually leverage dems put corner republican two option afraid get blame shutdown s correct way think republican insure democrat responsible shutdown house pass leave town mean issue decide senate option send something back house cleary johnson thune work option senate dems consist vote cloture dems responsible legislation dying dems responsible shutdown shutdown leverage dems especially schumer shutdown republican even leverage situation republican base amenable shutdown right continue blame democrat leave government shutdown democrat come table think schumer simply make good bad situation,President Trump,-2,negative,topic_1,Your Dark Creepy Back Yard

I'm also not sure what actions you are suggesting. Protests are fine for calling attention to an issue, but they will not be any more effective than court orders, and Trump still has strong support. You can swamp your Dem representatives and senators, but a DDOS' worth of spam isn't going to help them to get anything done, and they already disagree with and are working (in some way) to correct or combat the direction of the Exectutive Branch.

Federal legislators will continue to work to secure/preserve funding for their States. State legislators should be thinking about how to run programs they need that lose federal funding.

I think that donating to funds or NGOs that are fighting the legal battles is probably the most effective form of supporting the causes important to you. ""Civil Disobedience"" in the form of not paying taxes doesn't work when the gov't doesn't want to spend your money, though it's an option if they are spending it ""incorrectly"".

midrwlz,Reddit,2025-03-18T06:48:57Z,"It's a real shit show, to be sure. On the bright side, I'm having trouble confirming whether court orders that were at least initially brushed off continued to be defied.

[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/03/17/did-trump-administration-ignore-a-court-order-judge-demands-trump-officials-explain/) discusses the recent ruling against the El Salvador deportations, with White House officials alleging that allowing the *departed* flights to continue had some (debatable) justifications; the point being, though, that they implied that further flights would not violate the order.

When it comes to the mass firings and subsequent reversal, it is similarly unclear whether those workers have returned to work. This [NBC article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/federal-workers-future-uncertain-court-finds-firings-illegal-rcna196506) seems to imply that at least some have, but that they continue to feel insecure in their employment, which is completely understandable. Along similar lines, [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/nx-s1-5318039/fired-federal-employees-opm-memo) discusses the OPM walking back language in a memo such that it did not call for terminations (since that is outside their scope), but that it's not necessarily known how the targeted agencies responded (i.e. did the individual agencies/managers/directors reach out and bring people back).

Arguably, all of our talk of the administration not following orders is probably making things worse insofar as it reduces faith in a system that actually is working (or at least its cogs are turning), just not as quickly as people that want it to. People want things to change instantly, but that's not how the legislature or judiciary work. People seem to be calling for Republican-style disruption, but disruption is the goal of this administration, and you can't really fight disruption with disruption - further clogging the gears is just going to muck up the works, worse. It's harder to break things than it is to build them or to make them work.

The only big-ticket ""positive action"" that the Trump administration has engaged in is with respect to deportations and border enforcement. Other than that, their actions have been purely destructive, and we all know that it's easier to break something than it is to build it.

The obvious means of resisting the ongoing efforts of the POTUS aren't very snappy or Tweetable: the judicial fight is going to be long and full of appeals, and the legislature has little *direct* influence over the executive branch, though it can pass laws and assign funding in order to influence our national direction.

I mean, no that would be a tough sell. They could just lie and say they're going to get taxes down. Then, if voted into office, raise taxes on people anyway. 

From my understanding of the deficit it really started piling up after 9/11. The G. W. Bush tax cuts helped the wealthy, but more importantly the Bush administration spending was out of control i.e. added to the deficit significantly ( this is debated by the heritage foundation, go figure). I believe Obama extended those George w Bush tax cuts (rich get richer). Trump's 2017 tax act helped the top 1% even more. The government has been prioritizing the wealthiest of the wealthy for decades. 

Now we get the richest man in the world and his paw patrol to look for the most woke sounding projects to focus on, even if they're lies. Doge is ruining shit. 

There's no need to increase taxes on anyone except the super rich. If that can happen we can at least stop the deficit from increasing.. military spending is unchecked and if Doge got its paws on the military budget I'm going to bet they would find plenty of things to cut that could have a meaningful impact on reducing the deficit.

mifahdc,Reddit,2025-03-18T15:18:29Z,"The problem is that this wouldn't be a ""normal"" shutdown. Under an appropriations lapse, the executive branch still carries on ""national defense,"" ""law enforcement,"" and ""preserve life and property"" functions (that's the ""essential"" designation, technically an ""excepted"" tag).

Now remember we have DOGE champing at the bit to gut the government. Federal employees are being directed to report what they did each week to a DOGE-established email box (ostensibly as a ""pulse check"" but everybody with a brain knows they're feeding it into an AI model to try to target functions). And the POTUS issued an Executive Order to all agencies to come up with a ""Reduction in Force"" (RIF) plan that orders ""all components and employees performing functions not mandated by statute or other law who are not typically designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations"" be prioritized.

The fear is that a shutdown isn't ""just another shutdown."" A shutdown is Republicans going ""everybody that's furloughed? You're being RIFed because you're not 'essential.'"" Remember, DOGE's original goal was to cut federal employment by 75%. DOD is by far the largest agency employer, and *more than half* of DOD civilian employees are furloughed during a shutdown. Because logistics, planning, readiness, etc aren't directly engaged in national defense - we're talking people that aren't on the front lines if Russia invades Alaska tomorrow, but make sure the force can fight if Russia invades Alaska next year.

Avoiding the shutdown is an attempt to keep the federal government from being hollowed out overnight, so that Democrats, unions, and public sentiment have a chance to push back on Republican efforts to gut the government over the medium term. Because as we're seeing in the fight over firing and reinstating probationary employees, once people are gone, the administration is going to do everything they can to keep them gone.

Even as a pity obligation, every single one has involved at least one person from the other party to give it a go-ahead. Schumer set the precedent that this is okay.

Republicans even included what should have been a poison pill where it gives Trump the power to sidestep congress completely on budget decisions and the Democrats simply rubber stamped it. The claim that they're worried about all the government workers who will lose their jobs in a shutdown rings hollow when you're coronating Trump to slash and burn entire government entities at a whim anyway.

Moreover, Schumer agreed with the plan from the House Democrats to stay united against it. They all voted against the CR because *that was the strategy everyone decided on.* For Schumer to just go ""Actually, never mind"" is a betrayal of his colleagues driven, I assume, by his belief that senators matter more and he should not have to listen to members of the house.

In the future, every spending spending bill from Republicans will be negotiated simply among themselves, passed through the house easily, and they can assume Democrats in the senate will bend their spine as much as it takes for Republicans. Why not? It clearly works. They had leverage to stop them or at least clean up the CR and gave it all up.

Attempting to mitigate the damage that Trump does, just makes him seem more competent. Trump shamelessly takes credit for everything good, and finds a scapegoat for everything bad. Whenever Democrats have prevented him from doing something disastrous, Trump is able to claim that it would have worked all the failures of his administration are due to Democrats sabotaging him.

Shutting down the government to prevent Trump from downsizing the government, doesn't prove anything to anyone. Once the government *does* reopen, Trump can then assign any of the failings of his administration to the ""chaos"" caused by the ""Democrat's shutdown."" Any loss in services from his mismanagement will be confused with the loss in services from the shutdown. He will likely be able to convince his base that the downturn in the economy from his tariffs are actually due to the shutdown somehow, and they will believe it.

Since it is clear that Trump is more than a one-term fluke, the Democrats have to find a new way to actively beat Trump and people *like* Trump, and not just wait out the clock till their term is over.

Correct. Then the next step in that chain of events is a tranche of the ""essential"" folks quit, and Musk cuts his 75% of the government instead of the 50%. Again, the issue is that a shutdown could be leveraged for even deeper cuts to federal staffing (and capabilities) than even the ""move fast and break everything"" approach DOGE is already taking (and getting pushback on from the courts and segments of the public).

If you don't like Wired, [here](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/don-t-use-shutdown-plans-to-slash-the-federal-workforce) is a post from Lawfare, which Media Bias Fact Check rates as a ""Least Biased"" (*very* slightly left), VERY HIGH Factual Reporting, High Credibility site.

> Furthermore I don't think the EO was actually saying ""identify all non-essential in the shutdown sense staff so we can fire them"".

Then I suggest you read the EO, because that's exactly what it said. [Implementing The President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Workforce Optimization Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/):

>(c)  Reductions in Force.  Agency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and to separate from Federal service temporary employees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely be subject to the RIFs.  All offices that perform functions not mandated by statute or other law **shall be prioritized in the RIFs, including** all agency diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; all agency initiatives, components, or operations that my Administration suspends or closes; and **all components and employees performing functions not mandated by statute or other law who are not typically designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations** as provided in the Agency Contingency Plans on the Office of Management and Budget website.  This subsection shall not apply to functions related to public safety, immigration enforcement, or law enforcement. 

It's right there. Anybody ""not typically designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations"" are among the groups to be prioritized in the RIF plans.

There is a... we'll call it ""very odd"" (because I hate to accuse people of bad faith without evidence or at least a significant history) reading where you could try to say those categories only apply to the temps and reemployed annuitants. Without going into detail, that is NOT how agencies are interpreting that, to the best of my personal knowledge.

> You also appear to not understand the definition of ""furlough"".

The technical definition is in 5 USC 7511, in case you were wondering:

>(5) ""furlough"" means the placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay because of lack of work or funds or other nondisciplinary reasons.

It comes out of the Anti-Deficiency Act, where the executive can't spend money that hasn't been appropriated. No funds, no work, no pay. 31 USC 1341 says furloughed and excepted alike get backpay, but if you trust the Congressional Republican majority to not change that, then you trust them a lot further than a lot of other people. Prior to 2019, backpay even for ""excepted from furlough"" workers was custom, not law, and if the current situation has shown us anything, ""custom"" is no guarantee of ANYTHING.

And having actually *been* subject to furlough (including a ""you're on the furlough list, but if XYZ happens then we'll call you and you'll be ""essential"" for the three hours it takes to deal with it, then you can go back on furlough"" position back in 2019, that was fun - because what is furloughed and excepted is determined by the activity, not the person, and some people conduct a wide variety of activities), as well as going through all the lapse of appropriations drills in prep for shutdowns several times over my career, maybe think again.

mimfrae,Reddit,2025-03-19T17:22:27Z,"The continuing resolution (CR) that was approved consolidates the powers of the Executive Branch and takes away powers from the Legislative Branch and the Judicial Branch.

The continuing resolution lets the president unilaterally form new MILITARY programs. Senator Chris Murphy talks about it in an interview with Jon Stewart.

The continuing resolution gives the president the right to cut any program without the need for congressional approval.

The continuing resolution gives the president the authority to raise tariffs unilaterally. Yes, he has been doing this already, but this CR makes what he did legal.

The continuing resolution legalizes the illegal actions that the Executive Branch have been taking taking since the inauguration, such as firing people who predict our weather (NOAA), who help people after disasters (FEMA), who monitor our nuclear facilities (DOE), who provide many of us with health insurance and who help veterans, etc. These firings were illegal and the courts have been fighting these actions. But due to this year's CR, the courts will no longer have authority to continue lawsuits against the Executive Branch.

Here is rebuttal to the people mentioning those who would be harmed by a government shutdown:

First, thank you for thinking of, and advocating for, our most vulnerable Americans. Yet please understand something important.

Most of the people repeatedly calling and writing their legislators to vote no to cloture and no to the continuing resolution were people who will be affected strongly either way, i.e. people who are recipients of Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, SNAP benefits, and Veterans who will lose services at the VA.

The argument was ""We are willing to see a temporary stop of our benefits, in order to prevent this administration from making severe cuts to our benefits permanently.""

I tend to say that economic politics allow you to live, while social politics allow you to live in a place that you want to live. As an example, just because I could live in Egypt with a high standard of living, does not mean that I want to live there even if where I am currently living offers a much lower standard of living. There would be linguistic, cultural, racial, religious, and other differences which would make living there much less pleasant. 

Was the civil rights movement of the 60's a distraction? 

I am just speculating, but I would imagine if you went through history, you would see ebs and flows where society is more concerned with economics vs more concerned with social change. Once one picks up steam it tends to dominate the discourse for a couple of decades and then something else switches. The past 20 years have seen some fairly major social changes, I am old enough to remember when Gay marriage became legal.

mio29n7,Reddit,2025-03-19T22:07:51Z,"Abso-fucking-lutely.

The political and economic elite are more than happy to keep people screaming at each other over culture wars and other similar issues while they quietly rig the economy in their favor. Ultra wealthy donors, politicians, media conglomerates, and propagandists both foreign and domestic all play their part in manufacturing division.

That doesn’t mean the issues themselves are fake. The best propaganda doesn’t fabricate. It distorts and amplifies. Racism, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration. These are life and death struggles for the people being targeted. But for the ruling class? They’re tools. Distractions. The people at the top are rich enough to be unaffected by these fights, and they have no problem weaponizing them.

For the average person, none of it actually solves their problems. But easy anger and outrage are addictive. They fill some festering, unfulfilled gap left by the grind of modern wage slavery. People are anxious and crave something to be self righteous about even if they are wrong and shitty people for it. So many of them are too stupid and monkey brained to do anything other than take on the constant bombardment of propaganda spoon fed to them as their own

No one is losing their home because of trans athletes. Stagnating wages aren’t caused by undocumented immigrants. But these are the fights that dominate the news cycle because they give people a false sense of purpose, no matter how misguided. Meanwhile, if the same energy were directed toward wealth inequality, unchecked corporate power, or the erosion of labor rights, the ruling class would have a real crisis on its hands.

The media knows exactly how to game this. Just look at one of today’s headlines about Trump ""suffering"" multiple legal “blows.” We’ve been bombarded with this same style narrative for a decade. Something is always happening or about to happen. They tease us with something resembling a cathartic moment. They want you to believe justice is creeping closer, that the system is holding powerful people accountable. At this point, it’s psychological abuse.

Nothing comes of it. Billionaire sociopaths still run the country. Wealth is still consolidating at the top. Everyday people are still depressed as fuck and struggling to get by. There's no sense of community any more. The only real difference now is that we’re hurtling full speed toward whatever the fuck comes next. Maybe it’s a cyberpunk dystopia where corporations control everything because they’re richer than most nations. Maybe the filthy peasants finally reach their breaking point and pick up their pitchforks. Neither solution sounds all that pleasant for the average shmuck.

This isn’t just about division. It’s about exhaustion. It’s about keeping people too demoralized to push for real systemic change while spoon feeding them selective outrage.

Culture wars and propaganda take an issue that has some basis in reality, amplify it, and turn it into a focal point of public outrage. I'm sure there’s a reasonable conversation to be had about trans people in sports but that’s not what's important.

The real issue isn’t what the debate is about. It’s why this debate is even taking up so much space in the first place. This affects an incredibly small number of people, yet it’s been elevated to a defining crisis in the national conversation. Why? Because the people pushing the culture war keep hammering on it until the average person feels like they need to have an opinion.

Most people aren’t impacted by it enough for it to be a major, or even a miniscule, concern in their daily lives.

>Are culture wars used to divert attention from class struggle?

The first thing the question tells us is they think the class struggle is/should be the core of politics. 

The second is they think there is a concerted effort by someone/s to keep people from the class struggle.

The third is they think this is done through focusing on the culture struggle instead of the class struggle. 

The question itself presupposes that class struggle is the core of politics. 

The question also presupposes that those on the side that favour the status quo will attempt to divert attention away from class struggle. 

The final presupposition is that culture is a *false* issue only being used to distract from the *true* issue, class.

For all those presuppositions to be true one has to accept a basic Marxist/materialist outlook on politics and that ones opponents also accept it and thus intentionally distract from it with things the same person considers to be trivial but inflammatory, in this case culture.

This is a fantastic strawman, but it doesn't really hold up when compared to reality. 

Most conservatives don't buy into Marxist/materialism, they don't accept that culture is trivial, and they certainly don't think they are behaving cynically to prevent class struggle. From their perspective it is the left that has engaged in a continuous struggle to change their culture without their permission. They see the left altering culture through controlling key cultural institutions (universities, schools, art, civil administration, judiciary, etc...) which they then see as a top down attempt to enforce leftist views and ultimately *brainwash* their children out of traditionalism. 

Ironically the left don't see any of this as an issue. There's certainly a sense among the left that they have a right to control cultural institutions and prevent them from being used to propagate right wing views, because it's *propaganda*, but then don't see the same issue with them pushing their own ideas because they are *moral*.

Ultimately, both sides are unable to understand why the other acts the way they do, because they totally dismiss the other side's analysis as illegitimate.

Yes, the right wing elite do use cultural issues to distract from class issues, but that doesn't invalidate the cultural issues.

Hawaii is a good example. Dole pineapple Sanford B. Dole, a prominent figure in Hawaii's sugar and pineapple industries, was a key leader in the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. He and other wealthy American and European businessmen sought annexation to secure their economic interests, particularly to avoid tariffs on sugar exports to the U.S. In 1893, Queen Liliʻuokalani attempted to restore power to the Hawaiian monarchy by drafting a new constitution. This alarmed American businessmen who feared losing their influence. U.S. Minister John L. Stevens, orchestrated a coup against the Queen. U.S. Marines from the USS Boston were deployed to Honolulu under the pretext of protecting American lives and property but effectively supported the coup.

Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, is often referred to as the ""father of public relations"" or ""the father of spin."" He's known for his work in manipulating public opinion and shaping consumer behavior through the use of propaganda and psychological techniques. Bernays' work laid the foundation for modern public relations, advertising, and propaganda.

Bernays' most famous book, ""Propaganda"" (1928), outlined his approach to shaping public opinion. He argued that the manipulation of public opinion was necessary in a democratic society, as the public was not capable of making informed decisions on its own. He believed that a small group of intelligent and enlightened individuals should guide public opinion.

Most common techniques used are:

1. Agenda setting: Selectively choosing which stories to cover and how to frame them to influence public opinion.
2. Framing: Presenting information in a way that influences how people perceive and interpret it.
3. Primacy effect: Presenting information in a way that creates a lasting impression, often by using sensational or provocative headlines.
4. Social proof: Using social media influencers, celebrity endorsements, or fake online reviews to create the illusion of widespread support or acceptance.
5. Gaslighting: Manipulating people into doubting their own perceptions or sanity, often by presenting contradictory information or denying previous statements.
6. Confirmation bias: Presenting information that confirms people's existing biases or beliefs, while ignoring or downplaying contradictory information.
7. Psychological manipulation: Using techniques like emotional appeals, fear-mongering, or nostalgia to influence people's emotions and decisions.
8. Astroturfing: Creating the illusion of a grassroots movement or public support by using fake online personas, bots, or paid actors.
9. Information overload: Presenting a vast amount of information to overwhelm people and make them more susceptible to manipulation.
10. Predictive programming: Using media and entertainment to shape public opinion and prepare people for future events or policies.
11. The manipulation of social media algorithms: Using algorithms to prioritize certain types of content, such as sensational or provocative stories, to keep people engaged and influence their opinions.
12.

And it's really, really fucking insulting to women and minorities who are being *specifically* targeted by this regime due to pure hatred and a desire to put them back in their place. It's not some ploy to ""distract"" from class struggle!! We are *actually* being denied rights that white men have. The oppression of women and minorities isn't a fucking ""distraction"" from the ostensibly more important ""oppression"" of white working class men LOL gtfo. It's REAL. Our oppression is real. Misogyny and racism are real and a part of the structure of our society! The narrative that it's *actually* a class war and women's suffering and the suffering of minorities is all a ""distraction"" from THEIR problems is based on misogyny and racism. Because the denial of misogyny and racism in society of any kind, even this bullshit narrative about how is *actually* a ""class war,"" is literally racism and misogyny. 

Women and minorities make up the vast, vast majority of the poor. Almost all people making minimum wage are women, and especially women of color. Stats show the only white men making minimum wage are under 25. After that, *none* of them do. But women make minimum wage. And don't get raises the way men do. 

1 in 9 women are in serious poverty. 20% of black and Hispanics are in poverty. Only 7.7% of white people are in poverty and the vast majority of that 7.7% are *women.* That's no accident. I'm serious, if you are a straight, able bodied white male you are literally *not* in the kind of poverty that women and minorities are. You're simply not. Maybe they are struggling, but it's the difference between struggling at 50k a year and 30k a year. You're acting like there is this large homogeneous group called ""the poor"" that the rich are coming after, and that is simply *not true* at all. The SERIOUSLY poor are almost exclusively women and minorities (with groups like the disabled being defined as a minority). 

The *only* white men that are poor in the way women and minorities are, are the mentally ill, disabled and addicted. If you're a straight white man and you aren't any of those things, you're not going to be ""trapped"" in poverty under Trump LOL. You are literally NOT experiencing the kind of poverty women and minorities are. All his policies are *not going to affect you.* They aren't *meant* to affect you!! Straight white men who think this is ""a class war"" have no fucking CLUE what actual oppression is. White men have always had economic opportunities and the opportunity to self actualize in a way women and minorities didn't. The ""poor"" were not being kept down, the vast, vast majority of the poor are and always have been women and minorities!! EXCEPT during the Industrial Revolution! But that time is long gone. That kind of *actual* class warfare is not really here anymore. 

The Trump administration coming after the programs that allowed women and minorities to gain more and more equality with white men are being taken away. Those same programs are the programs for the poor. Because they ARE the poor!!! Food stamps are being taken away. Why? Because almost all the people using food stamps are single mothers. The vast majority of people on Medicaid are women and minorities. Free daycare like headstart is being taken away, why? Because those programs enable women to be able to work. They are literally making it so women have to rely on men again. They are taking away the support system not of the poor, but the systems that allowed women independence from men. Their goal is to create a white nationalist, male supremacist regime. Not necessarily to increase inequality in general. 

White men, even poor white men have *always* had their rights enshrined in the constitution. The rights of white men are not up to be voted on, ever! Ours are though. Women and minorities (including gay and transgender people) have had *their* rights denied to them, and now they are stripping  those hard won rights from us *again!* The rights of the ""poor"" are not being taken away, women and minorities rights SPECIFICALLY are. Women and minorities have been oppressed in this country on the basis of their sex and race *alone.* Not their class. 

MAGA is a far right, white nationalist and male supremacist cult of personality. Trump himself is very corrupt and he is allowing the rich to bribe him  and giving the rich favors in exchange for their votes and to keep him in power. But the primary goal of his administration is not to increase inequality for the sake of subjugating *all* of the poor. Musk wanting to privatize social security and Medicare for example, is simply to make HIM richer, he doesn't see it as him getting richer at the expense of the poor. Privatization of those programs will primarily affect women and minorities!! For most white men, it'll actually result in a greater return on their social security investment! But women and minorities face discrimination in the workplace that white men don't, and now with anti-DEI it's going to get worse. White men are not going to have issues increasing their income if they need to. They are given promotions, raises, etc. It's a boys club at the top!! 

Women are being forced into reproductive slave labor for the state. And being forced to pay for it themselves because they won't have access to Medicare!!! Brown people are being sent to Guantanamo bay. And you think this is mostly a class war and not a war on women and minorities??? Literally right now there is a bill in the senate to limit women's right to vote. 

Most of the wealthy believe in the myth of the world being a ""meritocracy."" If you have merit, you won't be poor. To them, if you are poor you had the opportunity to not be poor *even without any social services,* and so it's YOUR fault if you are. They aren't trying to keep white men poor, they literally don't think white men *have* to be poor at all! In their regime, if they succeed, white men will all have the *same opportunities.* They won't *need* government safety nets. Whether or not they are rich is due to *merit* in their world. If a white man is poor in their regime, it's because he doesn't have ""merit"" not because they are consciously oppressing him. They are delusional. There is no class war in the U.S right now in the way you're implying. We are not in the time of factories or monarchies. The world has changed. 

Now. That being said, they did straw man identity politics on the left to get support. But that's only because they can't straight up be like ""yeah we just hate women, minorities and gay and trans people and we want to oppress them again."" So they pretend the left is harming society with their ""identity politics."" But the goal is the oppression of women and minorities. People needed to be able to vote for a white nationalist and male supremacist regime that they want while being able to hide their true motives. And misrepresenting identity politics and painting liberals as the enemy, the right as saving ""freedom"" was a good way to do it.

It's also true that they are taking away things like the ability to unionize. THAT can be interpreted as a ""class war.""

Straight, white, abled bodied (no disability, serious mental illness or addiction issues) men are literally *not* in poverty the way women and minorities are. And by minorities I mean the disabled, gay and trans as well. *At all.* There are no laws or structures in place limiting his economic mobility!! There literally aren't. 

There has not been a *true* class war since the Industrial Revolution. 

The Trump administrations goals are to achieve a white and male supremacy. The rich believe in a ""meritocracy."" They believe that if you are a straight, able bodied white man, and you are poor, that's your fault. They are not consciously trying to make you poor lol. They are limiting the economy opportunities of women and minorities though! They believe they are rich because they *earned* it. And they believe that white men have the same opportunities to get ahead as they have. They don't have any goals to maintain a class of poor white men through oppression, they think there is equal opportunity in a meritocracy. 

And if you are a straight, white, able bodied man? You DO have economic opportunity!! That's very fucking clear, because men hold ALL the real wealth in the world, particularly white men. And white, able bodied men are simply *not* in the kind of poverty that women and minorities are!!! Literally. The people who make minimum wage are mostly *women.* The ONLY white men that make minimum wage are men under 25. Outside of that age group, NONE of them do. 1 in 9 women are in serious poverty. 20% of blacks and Hispanics are in poverty. Only 7.7% of white people are in poverty and the *vast* majority of that 7.7% of white people are WOMEN. The minority of that 7.7% that are white men are pretty much all disabled, have serious mental illness and/or addiction or have a criminal history. 

Like...the difference between a ""poor"" white man and poor women and minorities are the difference between making 50k a year with opportunities for income increases, and 30k a year with no opportunities respectively. 

Let's just stop pretending that the ""poor"" are a homogeneous group of people of all sexes and colors because they fucking aren't.

Under Trumps regime, able bodied white men will have economic opportunity. It's women and minorities that won't. The programs they are taking away are the same programs that women and minorities have used to gain equality. THAT'S why they are being taken away. It's mostly single mothers on food stamps, not single white men that aren't disabled.

The rights of women, minorities and gay and trans people are literally being stripped away. Our rights *specifically.* Not the rights of the ""poor."" We are targeted specifically!!! Women are being made to provide reproductive slave labor for the state, brown people here legally are sent to Guantanamo bay. Trans people are no longer able to live as the sex they identify as!!! There is a bill right now that will limit women's right to vote. The anti-DEI shit is to keep women and minorities poor!! Not white men. This narrative that it's *actually* a class war is fucking offensive. If it was, we'd see ALL of the middle and lower classes unable to achieve economic mobility *regardless of their race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability.* But we DON'T see that. We see straight, able bodied white men able to achieve economic mobility with little to no barriers at all! Inflation, stagnant wages, ect. are not due to policies enacted to limit economic mobility for everyone! It's due to factors determined by a free market. There *are* however new policies, executive orders, revoked executive orders, ect. That has the effect of *specifically* limiting the economy mobility of women and minorities in particular. Those actions don't affect the economic mobility of anyone outside of those groups. It's not ""class warfare"" if only women and minorities are being targeted and losing rights and economic mobility. It's a very obvious war against women and minorities specifically.

The Tariffs are not class warfare either. Not *really.* They are to increase revenue and ""dominate"" other countries. He's trying to address the budget deficit caused by cutting taxes for his rich buddies. But cutting taxes on the rich is not for the *purpose* of keeping the poor, poor. He doesn't give any shits whether or not white men stay poor or move up a class lol. It's because his wealthy supporters were promised this if they helped him get elected. He accepted bribes to get in power. His goals were *power.* Not specifically to subjugate poor white men, he doesn't care about that. He cares about using bribes to stay in power. I guarantee you the lower and middle class white men and whether or not they can achieve economic mobility is the last thing on his mind lol. He literally doesn't care! He *does* however care about women and minorities gaining enough economic mobility and equality that white men are no longer on top. He's said as much. Literally, if at the end of his term 90% of white men made a million dollars he'd take credit for that and think it was great LOL.

Everyone else making minimum wage are primarily women, then minorities, often women of color. Because of sex and race discrimination in the workplace. 

This isn't a class war. It's always been a war on women and minorities. Women and minorities are being oppressed, have been oppressed. 

We do not live in the time of factories during the Industrial Revolution. Times have changed. Capitalism has changed. There is no *true* class war.

The few white men that are in the kind of real poverty women and minorities are in are disabled, have serious mental illness and/or addiction issues. Women and minorities experience poverty primarily due to oppression and discrimination based on their race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. They aren't poor because the poor are being oppressed for being poor with the goal of oppressing the poor.

miozp2n,Reddit,2025-03-20T00:54:23Z,"You fundamentally misunderstand how China approaches intergovernmental relationships and their relationship with Russia. To understand China, you have to grasp a few things. In terms of foreign policy, they really only care about reclaiming Taiwan. In general, they seek to once again become the hegemon of Asia, not the world, as they were during Imeprial times. In that regard, they aren’t unlike Putin in his revanchist view of Russian and USSR imperialism. Otherwise, they are mostly pro-business. They couldn’t care less about soft power (since they have so little, relative to hard economic and military force) and will do business with anyone, whether you are the freest democracy in the world, or you’re North Korea. They are anti-American, but only because America is forced to resist China’s ambitions in Asia. China’s relatively passive toward Japan and South Korea, as other powerful Asian countries but they seek to dominate the South China Sea, which antagonizes the Philippines, and take Taiwan. The US has no choice but to oppose this, leading to our current conflict.

Russia and China are not natural allies. They are allies of convenience due to mutual anti-Americanism, but aren’t fundamentally aligned like the US and Europe have been. The USSR and China hated each other from Stalin’s death to nearly the end of the Soviet Union, which is how Nixon and Kissinger convinced China to side with them against the USSR later in the Cold War. They have fought border skirmishes and only in the last few decades, China formally ceded territory in the Northeast to Russia. China also doesn’t promote authoritarianism in other countries, and doesn’t see any kinship between itself and Russia of the back of authoritarianism. It merely sees it as beneficial for its own continued ascendancy. It is completely agnostic in other country’s affairs other than wanting to become more powerful and richer, and will support anything to further this goal.

When Nixon approached Mao, he knew that China disliked the USSR, and sought rapprochement to combat a common enemy, not because China’s ideology was in any way compatible with the US’s. The same occurs now, except China leverages Russia’s desperation to weaken the US and secure cheap goods/materials for themselves. Trump does truly want to break them apart to deal with China, but he doesn’t understand that China and Russia are economic partners more than actual allies, so any closer ties to Russia serve only to alienate European allies, not change the actual scope of Chinese economic ties with Russia. That will persist no longer how much Trump caves to Russia, so all he does is aid China in their rebuilding of relations with Europe and even other Asian countries. Already, important European heads of state, as well as Japan’s new PM, have met with Xi or talked about the necessity of increased mutual trade, which all serves to benefit China in stripping America of its global control over developed nations’ foreign policy.",fundamentally misunderstand china approach intergovernmental relationship relationship russia understand china grasp thing term foreign policy really care reclaim taiwan general seek become hegemon asia world imeprial time regard aren t unlike putin revanchist view russian ussr imperialism otherwise mostly pro business couldn t care little soft power since little relative hard economic military force business anyone whether free democracy world re north korea anti american america force resist china s ambition asia china s relatively passive toward japan south korea powerful asian country seek dominate south china sea antagonize philippines take taiwan us choice oppose lead current conflict russia china natural ally ally convenience due mutual anti americanism aren t fundamentally align like us europe ussr china hate stalin s death nearly end soviet union nixon kissinger convince china side ussr late cold war fight border skirmish last decade china formally cede territory northeast russia china also doesn t promote authoritarianism country doesn t see kinship russia back authoritarianism merely see beneficial continue ascendancy completely agnostic country s affair want become powerful rich support anything goal nixon approach mao know china dislike ussr seek rapprochement combat common enemy china s ideology way compatible us s occur now except china leverage russia s desperation weaken us secure cheap good material trump truly want break apart deal china doesn t understand china russia economic partner actual ally close tie russia serve alienate european ally change actual scope chinese economic tie russia persist long much trump cave russia aid china rebuild relation europe even asian country already important european head state good japan s new pm meet xi talk necessity increase mutual trade serve benefit china strip america global control develop nation foreign policy,Donald Trump,12,neutral,topic_2,Your Dark Creepy Back Yard

He did that to get support to take away the rights of women, minorities and trans gender people. They fear mongered that the left was trying to destroy America and turn the kids trans in order to take away trans peoples rights. Which they literally did. They also did it because they cannot just say ""we are a white nationalist and male supremacist"" regime. They have to get support for essentially white nationalist and male supremacist policies by fear mongering. That's why immigrants are ""dangerous criminals."" Why trans people are a threat to society. It's literally to take away their legal rights. 

Trans people should have the same fundamental rights as white men have always had and to be free from discrimination in the workplace, in housing, etc. to access medical care for gender dysphoria when they are 18, and to change their documents to the sex they are living as. Those are fundamental human legal rights. 

Anything beyond that is a separate issue. No one has a fundamental legal right to be allowed to participate in sports. I personally support the above wholeheartedly and it makes me sick what they have done to trans people, taking away their rights. But trans women should not be in sports. The thing is, you can disagree with trans women being in sports, but not take away all their rights. But Trump acted as if it was all or nothing. Either trans people are treated as if they were born as the sex they identify with in every single domain, even when it's unrealistic and unpractical to do that (like in sports, in research) and have rights, or they simply don't have rights at all. 

THAT was Trump's goal. To make people falsely believe that the left was advocating for much more than their basic fundamental rights and you couldn't have one without the other, and that's not true. 

But the goal was *very much* to strip trans people of their rights. Because they literally did! In a male supremacy regime, gender non conformity is a threat.

26% of Americans say they are liberal, 32% as moderate and 33% as conservative. How is that 1 in 10? 

You're arguing that to get white men to care about the oppression of women and minorities we have to lie to them and tell them that actually our oppression is not real, it's all a distraction from THEIR oppression, which is the same as our oppression. And that's fucking BULLSHIT. We shouldn't have to do that. It should be enough that women and minorities specifically have, and currently are losing our rights on the basis of our sex, race, gender identity, sexual orientation and disability status. Because of racism and misogyny. That should be enough. 

That being said, Trump's policies ARE horrible for the economy. The stock market is crashing. We are headed for a Great Depression. That should be enough as well!! None of the above are happening because of a true class warfare, but it shouldn't have to be about that for people to care!! Wages being stagnant while inflation soars is also not because of intentional ""class warfare,"" not *really.* However, wages STILL need to be increased regardless of that. But there is no intention to keep white men poor. They believe that minimum wage *shouldn't* be a living wage. They see it like a stepping stone. The problem is because of sex and race based discrimination, women and minorities have a harder time getting raises. And like I said, white men aren't in poverty because of minimum wage being so low. But women and minorities are! The statistics on who makes minimum wage show it's almost all women and minorities. The ONLY white men who make minimum wage are under 25, they aren't living on minimum wage like women and minorities are. They achieve economic mobility eventually. Economic mobility that Trump is not trying to prevent them from achieving! He is however, intentionally and clearly trying to prevent the economy mobility of *specific groups.* And whether or not minimum wage affects white men or not should not be a consideration *at all* for people who support a minimum wage increase!! 

The reality is there are no laws or policies being put in place specifically to limit the economic mobility of straight, white, able bodied men. They don't exist. Trump is not enacting any policies that make it impossible or difficult for them to achieve economic mobility. Trump is enacting policies that are specifically limiting the economic mobility of women and minorities. That's what the ""anti-DEI shit is. 

Women and minorities suffer poverty not because of ""capitalism"" and ""class warfare"" but because of discrimination on the basis of our sex, race, gender identity, sexual orientation and disability status.

But those cultural issues truly are more important that economic issues to the working class right now.

I would go as far as saying that those culture wars are actually a form of class warfare. It is a war between a white working class that is often racist, sexist, fascist, homophobic and culturally conservative, against both an underclass of poor non-white immigrants and against an upper-middle class that is often liberal, college-educated, and cosmopolitan, both of whom are culturally very different from them, and who are both in concurrence with them for jobs. Because good jobs with decent pay now often require to have a college education, so the working class is locked out of them to the profit of the upper-middle class, while the working class is also in concurrence even for bad jobs with poor immigrants who are willing to accept lower salaries and working conditions for them. So this is both a cultural and an economic war from the point of view of the working class. 

And this is happening everywhere in the West: In the U.S., the U.K, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, and so on. The white working class is increasingly and massively voting for the far-right everywhere. This is happening because of important social and economic changes in our societies that occurred in the last 40 years and that caused the rise of a college-educated upper-middle class and a decline of the blue-collar working class that now feels left behind by society, both economically and culturally. This is not happening because of specific policies from the part of the left, because the European Left is struggling just as much with it than the American Left, despite defending policies that are much more friendly to the working-class.",just copium part leave idealise work class vanguard fight capitalism something now mad work class turn even ally crook billionnaires just see cultural issue cultural issue truly important economic issue work class right now go far say culture war actually form class warfare war white work class often racist sexist fascist homophobic culturally conservative underclass poor non white immigrant upper middle class often liberal college educate cosmopolitan culturally different concurrence job good job decent pay now often require college education work class lock profit upper middle class work class also concurrence even bad job poor immigrant will accept low salary work condition cultural economic war point view work class happen everywhere west u s u k france germany italy austria white work class increasingly massively vote far right everywhere happen important social economic change society occur last 40 year cause rise college educate upper middle class decline blue collar work class now feel leave behind society economically culturally happen specific policy part leave european leave struggle just much american leave despite defend policy much friendly work class,Donald Trump,-22,positive,topic_1,Cosmos

But yet here we are in 2025 with one side of the political spectrum arguing that it's not that big of a deal and that everyone's blowing this out of proportion.

What are the stats for poverty there? It is STILL the case that a white man in a poor area has much, much more opportunity to better his situation than a woman. There are no laws or policies that are keeping him poor. But there are policies and laws keeping women and minorities poor, that are *intended* to keep them poor. Intended to keep women and minorities *specifically* from getting out of poverty due to race and sex discrimination and oppression. 

And actually, yes there are white men that have walked up to job sites, got a job, and within 5 years and no degree they were trained for management and made over 150k a year lol. That shit actually happens all the time!! White men will get jobs they don't meet the qualifications for, that's a statistical fact. While women and minorities in the same positions met or exceeded those qualifications, because they wouldn't have even be considered otherwise! But the white men were given jobs without meeting or exceeding the listed requirements. 

I personally know a white man who at 18 years old, aged out of the foster care system and walked onto a car lot and got a job on the spot. The male manager had a soft spot for him and trained and groomed him for management. Now? He's partners with that man's son and they both own the car lot. He makes over 250k a year. He never got a degree. 

Are you seriously going to tell me that an 18 year old girl could have walked on that car lot and the male manager (because it's mostly white men in upper level jobs) would have done the same thing for her? That she could have worked just as hard, even did every single thing he did *exactly* the same and had the same outcome? LOLLLL You're gonna tell me that his sex and race had *nothing* to do with his success? Or that it wasn't the factor that practically *determined* whether or not he'd be successful? 

I aged out of the foster care system. And I can tell you, that I worked my ASS off at my 1st job. Because it was that or homelessness. And my manager sexually assaulted me when giving me a ride home one night. This is after he made it clear I was a great worker! Imagine the position that put me in. And I know he did it because he knew my situation, he *knew* I was vulnerable and needed that job. But a man just as vulnerable as me got mentored instead. I didn't get the treatment that man did. *Because I'm a woman.* My sex had EVERYTHING to do what happened to me! What happened to the man at the car lot would have *never* have happened to *any* 18 year old girl! Period. 

You don't live in reality if you think white men are experiencing ""oppression"" of their ability to achieve economic mobility. You aren't living in reality if you think that man's story isn't common, because it IS. It is common. Quite a bit of successful white men's stories involve practically falling up, or being mentored by the white men on top. 

Women and minorities have not even been *allowed* to self actualize in any field they want, especially high paying fields until very, very recently.

mivzovl,Reddit,2025-03-21T02:49:59Z,"And remember, we are discussing class oppression vs. sex and race based oppression. The argument that OP is presenting is that there is no real sex and race oppression, it's all a part of a bigger *class* oppression. Class oppression literally means there are policies and laws in place that are *intended* to limit economic mobility for ALL of the poor independent of their race and sex and disability status. That's what ""class warfare"" is. I'm saying there are *no* policies and laws that limit the economic mobility of white men. There aren't. 

The question is whether white men have the ability to achieve *economic mobility* and if they don't, then what exactly are the policies and laws preventing that? And can you show that those policies and laws are intended to limit the economic mobility of poor white able bodied men and don't clearly target women and minorities? 

Because again, my argument is that a poor straight, white, able bodied man is NOT experiencing class oppression. He is not poor because of class oppression, because *overall* (I know different areas present different opportunities but that is due to economic factors not intentional class warfare, we are discussing economic opportunities *within* the area he lives) he has the FULL freedom to achieve economic mobility, there are NO structures in place that are designed to not allow this, as long as he is able bodied (i.e not mentally ill, not disabled, not addicted. And I'd argue that many, many white men in Appalachia fit the category of non-able bodied due to addiction alone. Alcohol issues are rampant there). 

An able bodied straight white man is not poor because he is experiencing class oppression. In fact, he is most likely not poor at all! Or if he is he is certainly not in the kind of poverty that women and minorities are, and there are ways for him to improve his situation. There are several paths to get out of poverty and none of those paths are being blocked by government policies designed to block him. 

But there ARE policies and laws that have blocked poor women and minorities from having the same economic opportunities and mobility as able bodied white men. This is exactly what the anti-DEI policies are!!! To block the economic mobility of women and minorities. NOT white men. Clearly. And those policies and laws are based on *sex and race discrimination.* If they didn't experience sex and race discrimination at all, if there was not societal misogyny and racism, if they had the exact same rights and protections as white men, then they'd have the same economic opportunities. The policies Trump are putting in place *specifically* limit the economy mobility of women and minorities (remember minorities in this context includes the disabled).

Edit to add the quote: ""West Virginia ranks 46th nationally for the share of women in poverty; 19.8 percent of women in the state aged 18 and older are in poverty, compared with 16.5 percent of West Virginia’s men (Table 1). ""

>it's NOT the same kind of poverty at all,

All poverty is different. Appalachian poverty tends to look like ""subsistence farming and hunting, with no utilities"" and maybe not even treated water - there are houses within 30 minutes of ""the city"" that rely on wells for water, throughout the region.

As far as the rest, you're turning your personal stories in universal statements. I *know* women who was abused as a child, was at risk, and got mentored and coached through not only school but work into now being a six-figure department director. I *know* black kids who were handed six figure jobs directly out of school from friends and family. 

>You don't live in reality if you think white men are experiencing any kind of oppression of their ability to achieve economic mobility.

*Laughs in seeing predominantly white men companies being union busted and losing their jobs and blacklisted.*

Does the existence of class based oppression invalidate gender or racial based oppression? Absolutely not. But to say class based oppression isn't real or that ""white men"" don't experience hardship or oppression isn't living in reality.

The difference between women’s and men’s median annual earnings, $11,700, would pay for 3.1 years of community college tuition in West Virginia.

If employed women in West Virginia were paid the same as comparable men, their poverty rate would be reduced by more than one-third and poverty among employed single mothers would also drop by more than one-third

So where are you getting that 16%? Because you aren't reading that correctly. 

You do NOT know an 18 year old woman in poverty that was mentored by the same business owner who took her under his wing for years until he made her managerial director. You don't.

On contrary, it is already proven that it can lead to economic growth by filling up jobs which the natives may avoid taking up. Immigration also allows growth and development through influx of highly educated and skilled immigrants coming to seek better opportunity. Many issues like housing crisis, low wages are hugely due to systemic issues, government policies and way handling issues rather than immigration. But don't get me wrong I'm not supporting illegal immigration, but saying immigration is the cause of these problems is inaccurate and deeply influenced by misinformation and scapegoatism. 

There is enough housing for everyone including immigrants and in most cases issues and shortages is mostly due to systemic issues, poor management and policy failures rather than immigrants itself. And it turns out most anti- immigrants are more concerned with disproven conspiracy theories like 'great replacement theory' and Islamophobia rather than economic issues.

You want horrific acts? Let’s talk about what’s been in the news. Democrats have been pushing sanctuary city nonsense, letting illegal immigrants with rap sheets roam free—take that case in New York last year where a migrant, already deported before, beat up cops and got released without bail thanks to soft-on-crime DA Alvin Bragg. That’s not just incompetence; it’s a slap in the face to every law-abiding American.

Or how about the border crisis? Biden’s crew let over 7 million cross illegally since he took office, and just last month, ICE had to admit they’ve lost track of 300,000 unaccompanied kids—some trafficked, some dead, all on Kamala’s watch as ‘border czar.’ That’s a horror show, not a policy. Then there’s the economy—Democrats rammed through that Inflation Reduction Act, and what’d we get? Inflation hitting families so hard a MAGA mom in Ohio lost her kid to overdose because fentanyl’s flooding in unchecked, and she couldn’t afford treatment. Blame the open border and Democrat inaction.

And don’t get me started on DOGE—Trump’s efficiency plan might’ve cut some veteran benefits, sure, but compare that to Democrats slashing VA funding in real terms while funneling billions to Ukraine. A vet in Texas told Fox last fall he’s waiting months for care because of it—meanwhile, Zelensky’s getting red-carpet treatment.

1) Territory - The land itself isn't terribly well suited for conducting asymmetric warfare and hiding guerrillas. There are some places, but the vast majority really isn't set up for it.

2) National Pride/Tribalism - Every nation has some of this, but most 1st world nations just don't have that spark in enough people.

3) Ready Weapons - Even with hunting rifles and such, the armaments available at the get go to Canadians will be SLIM. Often this isn't terribly much a problem as they can just be smuggled in. Canada has a serious issue there with no overland routes and the US Navy, Air Force, and Space Force to reduce it further.

4) Space - You want enough space, but not too much and Canada has too much. It actually helps in tracking down where insurgents are and where they come from/get supplied from.

5) Surveillance - Canada has too much as it is, much less the full force of the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office, who run the US spy sats).

6) Personal Skills - Not only do you have to know how to fight to be a guerrilla, but you also have to know how to survive in the wilderness. A skill most 1st worlders lost long ago.

This is just a SHORT summary. I've studied Asymmetric Warfare for almost 40 years now learning first from my old SEAL Commander instructor (who was in 'Nam) in NJROTC in high School. I'm not saying it isn't possible, just that a lot of the advantages that really help aren't there for Canada. 

When fighting asymmetrically it's ALL about stacking every advantage you have up, hitting the weakest spot at the most vulnerable, and then disappearing before there is a reaction. The US has been dealing with that kind of fighting for 70+ years. It may not look it, but we are REALLY good at it. One of the reasons we don't look as good as we are is that the US Military fights with gloves and boxing rules in street fights when the other guy has a knife.

It is [entirely normal (link to a popular conservative group that provides protest/speech materials as an example)](https://www.tpusastudents.com/activismkits/) in this country for political activist organizations to advocate for people in the communities they serve in to become politically involved. The fact that they've been successful in this pursuit is NOT evidence of malfeasance on it's face.

Plus the idea that OP is espousing is very obviously not true and shows a serious ignorance about the history of the U.S, how exactly we got here and what the actual goals are of this regime. 

When the constitution was written, women and black people were literally *property.* The constitution says ""all men are created equal under God."" By ""men"" it was self evident at the time that this only included people that were legally considered ""persons"" and not property. In other words, people who could vote, fully participate in society. That was white men and some immigrants. 

What ""all men are created equal"" meant is that the belief system that some people are born superior, and created *by God* that way is not true. When there was an aristocracy and the lower classes in England and France for example, you were either born in the superior class or you weren't. And those born in the superior class ""deserved"" to be there because God caused them to be born in that status. There was *zero* class mobility. The ruling class would even practice incest because of this belief that their blood was superior. The lower classes were simply to accept their station because God put them there. There was a clear divide between the classes and that divide was set in stone. A lower class person was destined to be in the lower class. And the ruling class very much kept them there by force! 

THIS situation is what created class warfare!!! NOT capitalism! In America the idea was that all men [that were not property, i.e male and not black] were created *equal* by GOD. The ""ruling"" class was no better than the lower classes. They did *not* ""deserve"" to be there! God did not ordain that. There was to be economic classes according to the laws of a free market economy, but ANYONE could achieve class mobility! You could be born to the lower class and achieve economic mobility to a higher class simply by working hard, or working smart in a free society, within a free market. 

This was a *radical* idea at the time. And it made our country very wealthy! We do NOT have a ruling class that is enacting class warfare and perpetuating inequality because they need the lower classes to *stay there.* It's never been true under our constitution! There *are* ""rags to riches"" stories here. There is no ""aristocratic blood."" Capitalism isn't perfect, it needs several reforms, but ultimately it has enabled full class mobility. We allowed ANY white man to be educated! Any white man at all. Any poor person who had a good business idea could start one. What has been part of our country from the very beginning however, is that women and black people are NOT equal ""under God."" They are to be subjugated by white men. 

*The constitution had to be amended to include women and black people.* And then after that we had to enact laws to guarantee the rights of women and black people! Laws that are currently being reversed by the Trump administration!! 

EVERY SINGLE TIME (and I'm very serious about that) there was a policy enacted that ended up disadvantaging the poor, it was found to be *specifically* targeting black people and/or women as a backlash against them having rights and gaining equality. *Every time.* For example, poor underfunded schools almost always have something like a greater than 90% minority student body. They are in areas that continued to be segregated even after segregation ended. The decision not to fund them was to prevent black people from gaining equality (and this was admitted!) because not everyone accepted the idea that black people should access education, even after it was legal for them to do so! Women have only been allowed to be educated recently as well. Before black people, but fairly recently. Women and black people have not had rights very long. Reagan enacted policies that harmed the poor, and what was his reasoning? To target black people. Even the war on drugs was specifically to target minorities!! This was admitted! The fact that a relatively very tiny amount of poor, able bodied white men were affected was an inconsequential side effect! Besides, they believed that those poor, able bodied white men could easily better their situation in spite of those policies! And they were correct. In the 60s-90s, a poor, 18 year old uneducated white man could simply walk in a business and get hired on the spot and be the manager within 5 years if he was good at his job lol. He didn't need welfare. Welfare was needed for people who couldn't get high enough paying jobs because of discrimination based on their sex and race! It was for single mothers who were not allowed in high paying prestigious positions. Even when women could be educated, they faced sexism. Taking away these programs forces women to need to marry, which is what the Trump administration wants. They have said as much. Getting rid of programs that offset the economic effects of racism and historical oppression while they continue to better their lives prevents them from doing that. It's NOT class warfare. White men are NOT having their economic mobility limited. 

If class warfare was happening then the working class would not have voted for Trump. So why did they? Because they hate women and minorities. And the working class white men also *know* that getting rid of the programs that have allowed women and minorities to achieve equality will not affect them the same way! Because they don't. 

Racism and misogyny is not amplified by the upper class in order to get poor white men to vote against their interests. Trump and Elon ARE racists and misogynists!!!! OBVIOUSLY. It's not pretend, they actually do hate women and black people. Trump's misogyny was so disturbing to his former chief of staff, he called him evil. The poor white men voting for Trump are not being manipulated to be racist and misogynistic, they simply *are* because racism and misogyny is a part of the structure of our society, even at the very top

There is a kind of ""techno oligarchy"" going on with some of the billionaires, but again Musk is very, very racist and sexist and has no interest in preventing the economic mobility of white men. They do however have a strong interest in maintaining wealth and power. But that is not being done in the way it's been done in the past with *true* Marxist class warfare, where economic mobility of ALL the lower class is being prevented. Again, the idea is a ""meritocracy"" among white men, not an aristocracy. And no, giving poor men women and minorities to rule over to ""pacify them"" in their oppression is just fucking insulting. The Trump administration hates women and minorities just as much and has a strong interest in oppressing them for the sake of oppressing them. Not to distract poor white men from their oppression lol. Not everything is about white men. However, large corporations are absolutely not paying a living wage and that needs to be dealt with. Unions are needed. But as far as I know, Trump didn't make unions illegal.

mjdmu8q,Reddit,2025-03-24T00:40:28Z,"The other thing people need to understand is the INCREDIBLY low income cutoff to access those programs. You cannot be on Medicaid if you make more than 30k a year *in Ca.* You can't be on welfare, if you made more than 1400 a month in CA!! You can't be on food stamps unless you are the poorest of the poor. NOT simply struggling, not poor. But like...MEGA poor. Practically homeless. 

And the amount of able bodied white men that aren't on disability and are making 30k a year or less working full time, especially long term at least in Ca are almost zero. If not actually zero. Women and minorities are struggling with the effects of historical oppression and current racism and misogyny, women's reproductive burden has affected her ability to make a living wage. Women are often caring for sick family members as well. Women experience 3x the rate of PTSD men do, black people have 4x the rate of PTSD. And you can not be making a living wage at all and *still* not qualify for those programs. I can't stress enough, it's the poorest of the poor. 

And there simply aren't white men in a position to need those programs without being disabled or mentally ill or addicted to something!! They literally aren't. 

There's poor people (and those poor people include white men) and then there is the poorest people (and these are women and minorities and the disabled). And those programs are only for the poorest of the poorest of the poor. They literally aren't funded.

It is not a class war, because the INTENDED outcome in cutting these programs is to force women to need men again, and black people to stop gaining equality. It's not to keep ALL the poor down, because if you are an able bodied white man, simply having a full time job making $2 above minimum wage would disqualify you for those programs! In most states, working full time at minimum wage would disqualify you! 

Able bodied white men AREN'T on those programs

America herself decided she wanted the ability to counter Russia and act in nations across the globe. As well as use her vast navy in order to promote free trade and keep the seas open as it was in her interest to do so. Europe certainly benefitted from free trade and more democratic trade partners but ""America acting like she did for Europe's sake"" is in my opinion a pretty ridiculous line they are towing. 

In any case a aircraft carrier would be a prime target for French and UK submarines. So the notion that ""EU can't do anything"" is misinterpreting the balance of power. The EU could definitely run America out of Canada by supplying arms and making it too costly to keep it conquered. Especially since Canada is far too large in order to defend once key cities have been taken. 

With all its might America could not hold Afghanistan, but the idea is that it can hold Canada without other democratic nations pumping in money, supplies and military materiel? Especially with possible uprisings in America proper as well as possible desertions? I personally do not think so.

That was us working on 'fighting' an insurgency with our military. See the thing is the way to get a conventional military win against an insurgency is to be even meaner, nastier, and generally more evil than the insurgents (and yes, insurgents have to be evil in actions to win).

Russia has rightly been described as a mafia state. While the US isn't an angel, the Russians actively work to undermine many democracies around the world.

Republicans were big globalists and from a textbook economic sense it has huge upsides. Unfortunately, they did not consider the impact on workers and most people learn one trade in life. Take it away and it becomes very challenging to pick up something new. A more gradual shift in production would have helped workers do that, but the wealthy saw great opportunities in China and financed their rise in return for a couple decades of good returns. 

Parties undergo shifts every couple of decades. Some are subtle and some are huge. You'll see Republicans claim to be the party of Lincoln. Technically that's true, but at that time the Republicans were dominant in the northern states. What happened? Lyndon Johnson, a Democratic President from Texas in the 1960s, said it was time to recognize civil rights. Major parts of the Democratic party, mostly that dominated a racist south, did not care for that and shifted parties. The Republicans have had a stranglehold on the south ever since.

MAGA wants to bring all the manufacturing back. While some of that makes sense, there are good reasons to produce some things elsewhere because the work involves low value-added jobs that pay low wages like making sneakers or the manufacturing processes can be very detrimental to health like chromium production. People forget that in the 1970s the US had some serious issues - lakes and rivers catching fire and then Love Canal.

Anti-intellectualism should scare everybody. I will partially agree with you that universities have become big business and that has created problems. That's different from Republicans criticizing universities for being too liberal. My classmates recall no professors or otherwise spouting a liberal woke agenda. What we remember is arriving from predominantly WASP high schools and meeting interesting people of color, people from different nationalities, and people with different perspectives that over the course of several years made us realize as different as they were, inside most just wanted the exact same things. Living in isolation, strict church, small town, or rural farm rarely leads to interactions that result in understanding. That's what for all their problems turns urban centers blue.

The issue with Trump is that if you look at his prior circle probably 50% of his staff have said he was unfit for office. He has too many foibles to be a fair President, let alone a good President. While many of his constituents say they want to burn it all down and I share some of the frustration, is starting again from a smoldering heap going to produce anything better?

How exactly does a major political activist organization officially target opposition events to then not spend any money on it?   To me the whole point of a press release from MoveOn there was to inform existing/potential donors to help them fund the effort.

mjoii76,Reddit,2025-03-25T19:45:55Z,"That's very interesting. I can see from what youre telling me that the two parties have switched once more. With the left now serving  the benefit of the super wealthy who prosper from globalism( if only in the short term) and the right now supporting populism and the middle class. So it makes sense that our education system would try to protect what the super wealthy want.

Because I dont see Russia destroying democracies. Ukraine, with a dictator like Zelinsky, who killed an American journalist for speaking out against him, and who will not even let his people vote is certainly no democracy. Doubt forget, we handed Afghanistan to the Taliban. In fact Obama is responsible for Arab Spring. I see this as an excuse. This makes no sense to me. We are the biggest Mafia State there is. China is the second biggest. This is not why we have a problem with Russia. Im wondering if they are simply a convenient designated boogyman.

Globalism cant really be good. A one world government can not be good. And people have worked hard to build a successful country, and shouldn't have to share that success. Not to mention I have never even heard of anyone who simply jumps from skillset to skillset. Every human I have ever met generally speaking choses a career, and stays with that career their whole life. If a government isnt willing to put the welfare of their citizens ahead of the welfare of foreigners, even if those foreigners wish to be citizens, then why do we owe that government anything? It's like marriage where a husband cares about strangers just as much as he cares about his wife. How long will that marriage last?

I can also tell you this; My aunt was telling me how back int eh 80s people would swim in our local lakes. No sane human would get in them now. Our environment has become a hundred times more polluted then it was  back then. And the huge population increase has caused the destruction of some beautiful wilderness.

Now I was at the Uof Minnesota recently, I saw nothing but push for wokeness. I remember when we were all forced into a special seminar about how it's impossible to be racist to white people quite clearly. I remember a friend of mine getting ready to fire back, and I remember shaking my head, because there was no point, and he sat back down. Not one single professor at the university was even centrist. Of course it wasn't as bad as now, when jewish students cant go to class because they might be attacked.

I also remember a friend of mine was an education member. She was assigned one of the most disgusting books, which is standard reading for the major. It's ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed"" By Pauolo Fiere. So yes, our education system is entirely woke. I think everyone can admit that. That doesnt mean intellectualism is wrong. It means our current academia are small minded propagandists. I certainly have never seen any intellectual diversity in our universities. Everyone there thinks exactly alike. They are taught to assume that being liberal is just ""normal"" and that only uninformed and unsophisticated rubes believe in things like religion, patriotism, populism, and meritocracy.

And I dont think that its intellect that tuns urban areas blue. I certainly wouldnt call AOC or Crockett intellectual. They are dumb as bricks. I think it's poverty, fearmongering, and the fact that many people in urban areas are unassimilated foreigners. If these blue areas are so brilliant, explain the homelessness, crime, and poverty there?

I dont think MAGA are interested in ""burning it down"". I think they see the country and economy as already burned to a crisp( No pun about California). And they feel like they are the last chance to save it.

Trump is building up the military. strengthening our border, Lowering our inflation, lowering crime.

mjov89y,Reddit,2025-03-25T20:35:00Z,"There are a multitude of ways in which a political activist organization could spend money/time in order to advance a political message/activity without directly paying people to show up at town halls, as was claimed originally. They could buy targeted advertisements, pay a social media manager to post on X/Instagram, pay for Ubers, provide signage and stickers, form group chats to coordinate political action. If the claim was that political organizations were spending money to advocate for or boost a political message, I would say sufficient evidence has been provided to support that claim. The original claim, instead, was that the town hall attendees were **planted** by paid activists in an effort to shout down ""real constituents"". The problem with this claim is, according to all the evidence presented, the participation of the public in this campaign and at the town halls are entirely **voluntary** w/o any financial incentive provided. There's been no evidence provided that these people were not ""real constituents"".

Culture wars are the small battle on the edge of the same issue.

The class structure and race/gender discrimination have many overlaps. This is not new... Wealth used to (deliberately still does) directly follow family lines, titles would be inherited, land and jobs would pass from one generation to the next.

Well... Your all white so we can start there.... Names pass on the fathers side so we can add males only... But those are gone now... So... We can only rely on other traits.

While the opposition can't just make a law saying no Smyth's... They can chisel away at everything else... At the same time, they are a Smyth and living comfortably.... Getting a Smyth to change the rules that benefit them so much is hard.

That is not what I said.  Care to quote me on where I called them plants?  Clearly critical to the argument for it to be in bold text, but it is arguing against a statement I never made.  This appears to be a [red herring fallacious argument](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Red-Herring) that keeps getting more and more carried away with the “paid” part here while continually ignoring the main point about “manufactured” outrage.  In the proper context of a large political activist group officially targeting opposition town halls to manufacture outrage, then the paid activism would refer to the funding.  The average congressional constituents are not funded to be at a town hall and cause disruptions to make the news.  Their concerns often go beyond politics too as maybe they have an issue with a federal agency and need help from their federal representative while also seeking a public forum to see if others are having the same issue.  Hard to do that when large political activist organizations, like MoveOn, targets those town halls to manufacture outrage over political agendas that has the lowest approval in modern U.S. polling history.

If you start reading through them you'll see a lot of them are restating existing law in parts, but portraying it as though he is making these laws anew. Its a ploy to create the appearance of greater power for the Executive. When things keep going like they have for years, now with the context that Trump ""ordered it,"" they will be able to claim those orders were actually the reason and make more of the public *believe* he has the power to make these things happen. You'll also find a lot of things that are not enforceable in the orders, but will still be done because the entity being compelled is on team Trump. 

The rest of the content in the orders, at least the majority of them, are not within the power of the President. They'll of course be argued that they are, some will get through, some will never even be acknowledged. The point is not for these orders to actually matter or be followed. The point is to normalize an extreme amount of executive action. 100 orders in 100 days is *unheard of.* that's half as many as his entire first term, which already broke records. 

Beyond that, we're seeing an increase in Presidential power hitherto undreampt of in the United States. Immunity from criminal acts is insane, and something that would have saved Nixon from resignation. The normalizing of executive orders outside the scope of executive power is very concerning. With a House and Senate in his corner, and a Supreme Court more often in his corner than not (though honestly they've been just and stood against him a lot more than I expected, especially Barret and Roberts), its unlikely that he'll be challenged much in creating this precedent for power. 

The ultimate goal is clearly to shift law making and interpretation away from Congress and into the Executive Office. They want to consolidate federal power in one branch of government. It seems like they want to dump Marbury v. Madison and make the Supreme Court just another Court of Appeals again, and they want to relegate Congress to a collection of committees for recommending laws instead of actually creating them.

Sure, by pointing out that the document you cited has the budget for the employees that are hired.  But that wasn't the question or point of this.   A budget is not Congress saying how many employees each department and each division of that department must have.  A budget for the department is based on the request of each department for how many people they need to achieve their purpose.   It is not Congress demanding the number of employees but the department requesting funding for how many employees they need.  These departments now require fewer funds for fewer employees  So yes, facts and logic are the standard.

Every single manufacturing plant that I know of is looking to hire experienced laborers. Every single one of them has been looking to hire those experienced laborers since way before COVID and nobody can find them.  Experienced laborers that don't already have jobs, just don't exist. We can't magically make them appear by waving our wand and hoping a lot.

Sure, you can go to college and learn how to read a book and memorize information. But that costs a ton of money and once you graduate, you know very little that is actually applicable to the trades. So when you apply to the trades, your resume competes against people who have never gone to college.  The winner is always the person with actual field experience or experience that is relevant in something adjacent to the position you are applying for. 

Heck, even colleges don't teach what the industry is actually looking for most of the time.  I've hired a few college interns over the years out of both electrical engineering and mechanical engineering programs. When I gave them their exit interviews at the end of the summer, I always ask how much of what they learned in college was actually useful.  Their response is always less than 5% to 10%.  The problem with engineering degrees is that the real world fields are so vast that a college can't hope to teach things that are actually relevant to every industry.  For instance, is an electrical engineer going to get out of college and design circuit boards or are they going to be designing power distribution systems for the grid?

ml4xrjt,Reddit,2025-04-03T05:35:49Z,">If imported goods become more expensive, it stands to reason that at least *some* production would move to domestic facilities.

No, that doesn't stand to reason at all. Before *any* production would move to domestic facilities, it would have to actually be cheaper to produce the goods here, than it is **to continue producing goods elsewhere at the new price**.

But there's a million things that make it expensive to produce goods in the US: worker wage expectations; skilled worker availability; simple economies of scale. If you produce 80% of the global supply of widgets, and the US is 10% of the market, it is probably more expensive to shift 12.5% of your production to the US, than it would be to just let the price rise.

>The announced tariffs also claim to pursue ""fairness"" and ""rebalancing"" in trade. What's the evidence that US trade is unfair and imbalanced now?

Tariffs are one of those things where you don't have to guess. They are set by law, so you can use the actual laws combined with records of trade volumes, to calculate the average tariffs that exist on the trade between any two countries. Although the US has relatively low tariffs globally, if you take the EU, for example, [they simply do not have higher tariffs than we do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tariff_rate).

That's a Wikipedia link but their best data source (of three) is the World Bank (which uses an applied weighted mean on all products); as per their data the US simply imposes higher tariffs than numerous developed countries do: the EU, the UK, Mexico, Singapore, Australia.

And look at the countries with higher tariffs than we have. A lot of them are developing nations that are protecting their trade in order to keep people employed. For example, the reason why Chad has a 16.36% average tariff rate, has nothing to do with manufacturing-protectionism or anything silly like that, it's because [80% of their population are subsistence farmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chad), so *Chad actually can't afford low food prices*.

Because if the prices of sorghum or peanuts or yams in Chad were to suddenly go to rock bottom (the way it could with global trade), that would put an entire 80% of their population out of work and precipitate a massive economic crisis that helps no one.

Low tariffs and the resulting low food prices *would* be great for Chad... because remember, 80% of them are farmers, but also, *the majority of them go hungry*. It's an impoverished nation. If Chad's people had non-farm means of employment, low food prices would be great for the city-dwellers, but they *don't have the luxury of low food prices*, and that's why tariffs are *a necessary evil* as a way to raise food prices, to support farmers, even in a hungry nation.

And it's this effect on prices that should really tell you what tariffs do: they raise prices. That can be necessary in limited circumstances, but it's never *raising prices is never just generally good*.

And in a developed economy? There's just no reason to raise the price of everything in a diverse, developed economy. The path to prosperity in a diverse, developed economy, is to have as many educated, skillful workers as you can, and to pay those workers so well that the best of them can use the cheap high-quality capital around them, to develop new products, that increase productivity for everyone.

Tariffs don't do anything to help with that. They do the opposite by making capital expensive.",import good become expensive stand reason less production move domestic facility doesn t stand reason production move domestic facility actually cheap produce good continue produce good elsewhere new price s million thing make expensive produce good us worker wage expectation skill worker availability simple economy scale produce 80 global supply widget us 10 market probably expensive shift 12 5 production us just let price rise announce tariff also claim pursue fairness rebalance trade s evidence us trade unfair imbalanced now tariff one thing don t guess set law can use actual law combine record trade volume calculate average tariff exist trade two country although us relatively low tariff globally take eu example simply high tariff s wikipedia link good datum source three world bank use apply weight mean product per datum us simply impose high tariff numerous develop country eu uk mexico singapore australia look country high tariff lot develop nation protect trade order keep people employ example reason chad 16 36 average tariff rate nothing manufacture protectionism anything silly like s 80 population subsistence farmer chad actually can t afford low food price price sorghum peanut yam chad suddenly go rock bottom way global trade put entire 80 population work precipitate massive economic crisis help one low tariff result low food price great chad remember 80 farmer also majority go hungry s impoverish nation chad s people non farm mean employment low food price great city dweller don t luxury low food price s tariff necessary evil way raise food price support farmer even hungry nation s effect price really tell tariff raise price can necessary limit circumstance s never raise price never just generally good develop economy s just reason raise price everything diverse develop economy path prosperity diverse develop economy many educate skillful worker can pay worker good good can use cheap high quality capital around develop new product increase productivity everyone tariff don t anything help opposite make capital expensive,President Trump,29,negative,topic_1,United Kingdom

IEEPA was already the thinnest possible gruel for legal justification for tariffs when the President used it for Canada/Mexico tariffs.

The use of IEEPA requires a declared emergency under the NEA. It specifies that these powers *very specifically* only apply to the direct emergency declared (which was the reason for the fake fentanyl ""emergency"") and not beyond, and the claimed power of being able to upend international treaties and be able to make tariffs is hung entirely on the president being allowed to ""regulate... any transactions in foreign exchange"" in the statute.

Now this time around he's just claiming ""yeah its an emergency that we're being ripped off"" and deciding he just has unlimited tariff powers by saying that, and is overriding a pile of treaties and laws to do whatever he wants. 

This is lawless to the extreme. If it's allowed to stand it means that there is no meaningful check on the executive branch to make its own law, and separation of powers is essentially gone.

Congress could get involved and pass laws changing this or changing tariffs or whatever, but they're not, and Trump is inventing power out of whole cloth. It's genuinely absurd it's barely even discussed if this is legal, because it isn't, but this is so unprecedented I think people are a little unsure how to approach it. 

Also: Trump doesn't know what a tariff is, and seems to genuinely believe it is a tax that America levies on foreign governments instead of US importers.

No, it wouldn't, it would imply that they need to grow most of their food themselves. Here's [a clearer definition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/subsistence-agriculture):

>Subsistence farming or smallholder agriculture cultivates agricultural produce sufficient mainly to feed the household. **Surplus harvests, which are often very limited, are sold and traded**. This method is most widespread among rural poor areas.

Here are two more sources for the idea that 80% of the working population of Chad is involved in subsistence farming defined this way:

The [US International Trade Administration](https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/chad-agricultural-sectors):

>By most estimates, 80 percent of Chad’s population relies on agriculture, livestock, or fishing. **The market is primarily domestic**, and Chad imports a significant number of foodstuffs from Cameroon. There is little value-added production of agricultural products.

And [AFRIC, an EU-African trade organization](https://www.afric-eu.com/events/tsjaad-verwelkomd-de-wereld-van-de-agro-industrie-2/):

>Even today, **80% of working population** is directly affected by the primary sector, essentially by food production.

Those two details should clue you in on what you're missing: the market is primarily domestic, and it really is 80% *of the working population* involved in this.

What happens is that people in Chad do have to grow most of their own food. If they have a surplus (which is not guaranteed) they may then sell a little bit, in order to obtain things they don't produce themselves. That might be clothing, school supplies, foods you don't produce or aren't currently producing much of yourself. Someone with a lot of cattle may bring one to the market and get some grain during a dry season when their garden is not producing.

It's a subsistence lifestyle because the majority of what you eat you do have to produce yourself, or, if not you, a neighbor, you can't rely on commerce for the bulk of your food. And there's limited meaningful access to international trade networks for you to sell your goods. But the majority of your diet being self-produced is not necessarily enough to prevent starvation, so you do, *when you can*, buy and sell things for money, and that's the economy Chad's tariffs try to protect.",imply don t sell food anyways eat wouldn t imply need grow food s clear definition subsistence farm smallholder agriculture cultivate agricultural produce sufficient mainly fee household surplus harvest often limit sell trade method widespread among rural poor area two source idea 80 work population chad involve subsistence farm define way us international trade administration estimate 80 percent chad s population rely agriculture livestock fish market primarily domestic chad import significant numb foodstuff cameroon little value add production agricultural product afric eu african trade organization even today 80 work population directly affect primary sector essentially food production two detail clue re miss market primarily domestic really 80 work population involve happen people chad grow food surplus guarantee may sell little bite order obtain thing don t produce may clothe school supply food don t produce aren t currently produce much someone lot cattle may bring one market get grain spin-dry season garden produce s subsistence lifestyle majority eat produce neighbor can t rely commerce bulk food s limit meaningful access international trade network sell good majority diet self produce necessarily enough prevent starvation can buy sell thing money s economy chad s tariff try protect,President Trump,3,negative,topic_1,By the sea.

ml7z6gs,Reddit,2025-04-03T19:08:13Z,"As someone who owns a business in the industrial sector, I work with a mix of domestic and global manufacturers ranging from small US shops to large multinationals. I’ve been watching the impact of tariffs closely, and while I understand the stated goal is to “supercharge domestic industry,” I have yet to find someone familiar with the supply chains who agrees.  Most are pretty apocalyptic about it.

The basic logic makes sense, raise prices on imports, and domestic manufacturing becomes more competitive. But in practice, it’s more complicated. Many people I talk to still misunderstand who actually pays the tariff. It’s not the foreign government, it’s the US buyer, which means higher materials costs for American businesses. (There are very few business that don't require inputs from international sources.) And when foreign governments retaliate, foreign customers who are buying US products get hit with a higher bill, making the US products even more expensive for them!  
(https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/what-tariff-and-who-pays-it)

Take steel, for example. One small manufacturer I work with was originally all for the tariffs. He already sourced U.S. steel, so he figured foreign competition would get more expensive and he’d benefit. But what happened was that his own US steel prices shot up, because producers knew they could raise prices alongside the increased costs of foreign materials. Domestic producers saw an opportunity to charge more, and they did as they have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to make as much profit as they can. Say hello to American capitalism!  
(https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tariffs-to-allow-u-s-steelmakers-to-lift-prices-wsj-says-1034302554?utm\_source=chatgpt.com)

Even worse, larger customers with global supply chains pulled back. Their components come from all over the world, and many of those parts cross borders multiple times before assembly. One of our global customers with a manufacturing site in the US that has 250 employees ultimately decided to move the entirety of their high-value US based production to Europe. Why? Because they’d be paying tariffs on parts coming in, then their customers would be paying again when finished goods went back out of the country due to retaliatory tariffs. That made US manufacturing uncompetitive on the global market, and moving was the only way to keep costs down overall. A number of US suppliers are losing a lot of business as a result.  
(Not the particular customer I am referring to, but an example: https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/lindt-supply-chocolate-canada-europe-sidestep-tariff-hit-2025-03-04/)

In theory, tariffs might create pressure to “reshore” manufacturing. But in practice, they’re adding uncertainty and cost, especially for the high-skill, high-value industries where the US actually has a strong edge.

> Beyond economic considerations, tariffs are also seen as a means to safeguard national security. High dependency on foreign manufacturing, especially in critical sectors like technology and pharmaceuticals, poses risks. By encouraging companies to produce these goods domestically, the U.S. can ensure a more secure and reliable supply chain, which is critical during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

https://www.industryweek.com/the-economy/public-policy/article/55273536/trumps-tariff-plan-a-strategic-move-to-reshore-manufacturing

This has happened through decades of offshoring and the US finds itself with a very weak supply chain issue and often relying on geopolitical adversaries for critical supply chains.  The global supply chain certainly keep costs down, but is comes with a great risk as a significant disruption can cause the system to fall apart leading to shortages and surging prices:

>That fragility didn’t begin with the pandemic, however; it grew during recent decades as businesses focused on cost savings and efficiency gains.8 Global supply sources kept input costs low, and just-in-time inventories allowed businesses to further reduce costs while meeting aggressive timelines. But these highly efficient operations came with a high degree of risk; one broken link could bring the whole system to the brink of collapse. Making supply chains more resilient will require us to balance costs and efficiency against risk.9

ml8twzg,Reddit,2025-04-03T21:38:42Z,"I believe the issue is that these laws were written assuming that everyone involved was acting in good faith.  For example: 

https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701   

> Any authority granted to the President by section 1702 of this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, **if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.**

> The authorities granted to the President by section 1702 of this title may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared for purposes of this chapter and may not be exercised for any other purpose.

The second paragraph seems like a constraint, except it's easily bypassed by declaring multiple emergencies, however many you need, however often you need them.  Alternatively, you can declare a very broad emergency, and respond with very broad powers.   But who actually decides what an emergency is under the NEA?  Ah, well it turns out the President does: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1621

> ... the President is authorized to declare such national emergency. Such proclamation shall immediately be transmitted to the Congress and published in the Federal Register.

Then what are the criteria that the President needs to follow to determine what is or isn't an emergency?  

> 404 not found

There are no limiting criteria.  A national emergency is defined as whatever the President declares as a National Emergency.  

Who can tell the President that the emergency isn't an emergency?  No one.  Congress, however, *can* [terminate](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1622) a declared emergency, and they're actually supposed to automatically convene a vote on the matter every six months.  

Ultimately, (and this conclusion is editorialization on my part), from what I can see here the Presidency is fully enabled to carve out new powers for itself if there is a Declared Emergency, and also they are the one declaring the emergency.   An unscrupulous president can hypothetically declare many new ad-hoc powers in this way, and there's no mechanism for challenging it aside from Congress immediately terminating the Emergency Declarations themselves in what could possibly become a game of Balance of Powers Whack-A-Mole, or just impeach him.

Ultimately if one of the co-equal branches in a government decides on its own that it is no longer interested in exercising its powers and delegates it to the executive branch to make law through the abuse of emergency powers, there isn't a lot that can be done. In the end the systems are made of people, and as you say if they're not acting in good faith then no governing system can sustain itself without people putting in the work.

A funny addendum to what you said about the NEA and the emergencies is that in the law you linked it requires a joint resolution from congress to rescind it.

That's...not what the source says. It literally begins by mentioning ""friendshoring"" as key to protecting supply chains. The fact is there are some resources that the US simply  doesn't have  and will need to rely on friendly countries for. That's why maintaining good relations with friendly countries is so important. Applying tariffs to countries that have long been friendly, trustworthy allies is the complete opposite of that. The article also mentions the importance of diversifying supply chains, which means it's important to maintain good relationships with *multiple* friendly countries. The article also talks about government investment to enhance domestic production, especially in areas key to national security. That means supporting things like the CHIPS act. It means more government support of scientific research and R&D, not gutting funding from them.

So the key is maintaining good relations with countries who are friendly and who are part of the supply chain. In addition, increase government support and investment in domestic production. Notice how tariffs arent mentioned once, especially tariffing a neighbor who's about as friendly as you could ask for. If there are tariffs, the article's authors would likely suggest they be very targeted, particularly at critical industries. A blanket tariff on all goods and on friendly allies clearly runs counter to the principles espoused in the article.",s source say literally begin mention friendshoring key protect supply chain fact resource us simply doesn t need rely friendly country s maintain good relation friendly country important apply tariff country long friendly trustworthy ally complete opposite article also mention importance diversify supply chain mean s important maintain good relationship multiple friendly country article also talk government investment enhance domestic production especially area key national security mean support thing like chip act mean government support scientific research r have gut fund key maintain good relation country friendly part supply chain addition increase government support investment domestic production notice tariff arent mention especially tariffing neighbor s friendly ask tariff article s author likely suggest target particularly critical industry blanket tariff good friendly ally clearly run counter principle espouse article,President Trump,43,positive,topic_1,Your Dark Creepy Back Yard

It leads with reshoring as domestic supply chains are the fix to weak global supply chains.  Of course we still want global supply chain options as well for a more resilient system.  We certainly don’t want to rely on geopolitical adversaries who don’t have our best interest in mind to trust them with critical supply chains.

It's still a big problem if one of the sources contradicts the argument being made  The OP is asking about tariffs, not whether having a more resilient supply chain is important. For the sake of argument, we can assume that everyone agrees that having a more resilient supply chain and having *some* reshoring is important. 


>Please edit these false claims as direct quotes from the article are clearly “what the source says” and it clearly begins by mentioning “reshoring” to fix the supply chain problems. Friendshoring was only part of it.

Again, OP's post is about tariffs. The article begins with reshoring and friendshoring. It does not mention tariffs once. The problem is assuming that reshoring = tariffs. That's what the OP is disputing. And the article seems to agree, because instead of mentioning tariffs, it focuses on government investment in domestic production. And the article emphasizes  that restoring is not enough; we also need friendshoring because a single nation cannot produce everything. In this case, tariffs would run counter to the articles advice. To friend shore, you would need friendly relations with allied countries and to incentivize them to want to trade with you. The direct impact of tariffs is to reduce the amount of imported products, including from *friendly* countries. Mny friendly countries are not reacting well to the tariffs and calling them unfair. If you look at the numbers, they have a point. As mentioned previously, trump put a blanket 32% tariffs on all Taiwanese goods. **Yet there's no evidence that Taiwanese tariffs on US goods average anywhere near 32%. So it's clearly not a *reciprocal* tariff.**

If Trump were to follow the advice of the article, he would first identify products that are most important (critical to national security etc). Then he would make government investment in domestic production of said products (something like the CHIPs act). He would identify friendly countries that also manufacture this product and promote friendly trade relations with them (likely reducing tariffs instead of increasing them). At this point, if he wants to enact tariffs, they would be for *unfriendly* countries and specifically targeted for certain products.",argument clearly base two source just one please don t ignore one falsely claim fact support s still big problem one source contradict argument make op ask tariff whether resilient supply chain important sake argument can assume everyone agree resilient supply chain reshoring important please edit false claim direct quote article clearly source say clearly begin mention reshoring fix supply chain problem friendshoring part op s post tariff article begin reshoring friendshoring mention tariff problem assume reshoring tariff s op dispute article seem agree instead mention tariff focus government investment domestic production article emphasize restore enough also need friendshoring single nation produce everything case tariff run counter article advice friend shore need friendly relation ally country incentivize want trade direct impact tariff reduce amount import product include friendly country mny friendly country react good tariff call unfair look number point mention previously trump put blanket 32 tariff taiwanese good yet s evidence taiwanese tariff us good average anywhere near 32 s clearly reciprocal tariff trump follow advice article first identify product important critical national security etc make government investment domestic production say product something like chip act identify friendly country also manufacture product promote friendly trade relation likely reduce tariff instead increase point want enact tariff unfriendly country specifically target certain product,President Trump,33,negative,topic_1,"Alpharetta, GA"

mm5p0vd,Reddit,2025-04-09T07:06:18Z,"💯 The “leverage” everyone talks about was only an illusion.

Democrats were the minority in both the House and the Senate. They didn’t write the CR, couldn’t amend it, and didn’t have the votes to block it without triggering a shutdown. And that’s exactly what Trump and Musk wanted—a shutdown they could use to fire more workers, dismantle more programs, and blame Democrats.

The idea that Schumer “surrendered leverage” is wishful thinking. It wasn’t leverage—it was a trap. And refusing to spring it wasn’t weakness. It was damage control.

Millions of vulnerable people, including me, would have been hurt instantly. I say this not as a political strategist, but as someone who could have lost my home during this process. The student loan application freeze threw my loan payments into chaos. They went from an estimated $40/month to a hard $262/month. I don’t yet have the teaching job I went to school for. I’m scraping by as it is. If the government had shut down, I’d have been stuck in limbo—and I’m not alone. Millions rely on things like SNAP, WIC, and housing assistance. This wasn’t some abstract ideological fight. It was people’s lives on the line.

People talk about understanding the stakes. I hope you will all consider those of us living at ground level, not just in ivory towers, or podcast studios. 

But especially if the shutdown would not have harmed you: If you were safe. If you weren’t going to miss a paycheck. If you weren’t going to lose your home or benefits, why do you have no problem shaming a Democratic leader who chose to prevent mass suffering?

mm7vxp3,Reddit,2025-04-09T17:39:02Z,"Bad faith should *always* be assumed when it comes to the Trump administration.

If this could either be for Trump’s birthday or the Army’s 250th, we should assume the former by default unless overwhelmingly evidence shows the opposite.

And here, that is not the case. Trump is a dictator, and he wants to do dictator things. He has previously asked for a similar waste of funds in his previous term, where he was very publicly blocked.

In contrast, the Army has not previously done military parades on Flag Day. Not during past years, not during the 225th or 200th. 

So on one hand we have a record of Trump wanting these types of parades. On the other, we have evidence of the Army *not* wanting this.

Once again, if we just assume bad faith, we very quickly come to the correct conclusion: this is mostly for Trump, not the Army.

Further, let’s examine the idea that Trump would want a military celebration. This is not in congruence with Trump’s approach to the military. Trump was a 5-time draft dodger that faked injury to avoid Vietnam, and constantly skips military celebrations and honors. He chose golf over honoring dead soldiers literally last week, for example.

He does, however, honor himself. Constantly, vaingloriously. 

So again, we must use Trump’s Razor:

mmdjyxc,Reddit,2025-04-10T15:19:34Z,"I think the only question that matters in regards to JD Vance's political future is whether he can develop the personality to lead the trump coalition. I've seen very little indication that he can, he feels very unconfident and ingenuine when trying to bluster the way Trump does. For some reason I keep thinking about the donut shop clip, imagine trump in that situation. He would have found away, for better or worse to turn that into some sort of spectacle by berating the woman behind the counter or making some joke or just like, handling it in a way his base woulda been like ""that's my guy!"" Vance was just awkward and confused and demure. 

Because Vance had no real identity nationally before this, he has no grounds on which to run for president other than being a continuation of trump, and he won't be able to do that if he can't develop the right persona. Pence, for contrast, had a very clear and crisp identity before becoming vice president, he was a known quantity and had a known moral compass (not commenting on whether i think it was a good compass, just known). That was his undoing in the eyes of MAGA in the very end, and also why he was able to run against trump in the primary with at least some level of seriousness. The ins and outs of economic or foreign policy do not matter to trump's base (that's why the chess not checkers argument is so popular for them because they just follow whatever comes out of his mouth as perfect fact), and so the effect of tarriffs is too technical for them to care when evaluating Vance. 

Even worse for Vance, a LOT of people will be competing with him to capture the Trump Trance, precisely because they sense such weakness in his ability to do so. 

Two things could interrupt this dynamic, one being a premature rise to the presidency for Vance (via Trump death, resignation cause he's bored, or impeachement and removal because he ends up doing something so heinously awful we can't even conceive of it turning the GOP against him, but i'm just considering as many angles as possible here).

Claims:
- Current healthcare system is a scam and should be privatized.
- Trump is honest.
- Trump is not a rapist and suffers from law-fare. 
- Women’s bodies know how to give birth and modern medicine creates complications. 
- Black people should work harder to get to positions of power and there is an effort to oppress and hate white men because black people are the ones getting privileged considerations.
- His children in school were taught they were hated as white people. 
-  Tariff’s are a way to stop getting ripped off by other countries.
- Gangsters should be sent to El Salvador without due process because we can all simply tell that they are evil people. 
- Vaccine mandates during covid were a violation of civil liberties and a sign of fascism.
- The Kardashians are predatory to men and Bruce is gross for being trans.
- We live in agrieved times and women and minorities are just complaining rather than working harder. 
- 



This guy is someone I truly would not have pegged as being a Trumper.

[Tim Dickinson](https://www.rollingstone.com/author/tim-dickinson/)

*By dumping “billions” of gallons of water in the rainy season, the president is double-crossing the very farmers he claims to back in the state’s water wars.*

*In 2014, a teenage idiot was caught* [*taking a leak*](https://time.com/66459/portland-reservoir-pee/) *in an urban reservoir in Portland, Oregon. The diluted pee was no health threat; the reservoir is open air, and birds shit and piss in it daily. But the city made a decision, seemingly fit for a Portlandia sketch, to treat the reservoir as a ginormous urinal, flushing all 38 million gallons, before refilling the bowl.*

*I was raised in arid* [*California*](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/california/)*, where water conservation is a form of morality. As a then-recent transplant to the rain-drenched Pacific Northwest, witnessing this preposterous waste of reservoir water was something akin to watching a big-game hunter kill an elephant for sport.* 

*These ghastly feelings surfaced again last week as President* [*Donald Trump*](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/) *ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to uselessly dump “billions” of gallons of water from reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada foothills north of Bakersfield — attempting to warp physical reality to match his twisted hallucinations about California’s water engineering.* 

*Trump’s order followed weeks of ignorant bluster about how the catastrophic Los Angeles wildfires could have been prevented if only state officials had turned a mythical “*[*valve*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/01/23/california-water-trump-valve-la-fires/)*” to send more water to Southern California.*

*Trump displays no demonstrable knowledge of how wildfire works. Los Angeles was vulnerable to the catastrophic firestorms of the past month because the region had received 0.16 inches of rainfall since June, a full four inches below average, in the driest stretch in more than 60 years. It was a drought* [*exacerbated by climate change*](https://sustainablela.ucla.edu/2025lawildfires)*.* 

*This lack of rainfall made the grasses and scrub where foothills meet the Los Angeles cityscape — what planners call the* [*urban-wild interface*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildland%E2%80%93urban_interface) *— into a tinderbox. Trump, whose idea of getting out into nature is playing 18 holes at a manicured golf course, can’t seem to fathom that the canyons and brushlands surrounding America’s second-largest metropolis don’t benefit from sprinkler irrigation.*",seem keep usual idea water flow wildfire just tell librul environmentalist turn valve water pipe tim dickinson dump billion gallon water rainy season president double cross farmer claim back state s water war 2014 teenage idiot catch take leak urban reservoir portland oregon dilute pee health threat reservoir open air bird shit piss daily city make decision seemingly fit portlandia sketch treat reservoir ginormous urinal flush 38 million gallon refill bowl raise arid california water conservation form morality recent transplant rain drench pacific northwest witness preposterous waste reservoir water something akin watch big game hunter kill elephant sport ghastly feeling surface last week president donald trump army corp engineer uselessly dump billion gallon water reservoir sierra nevada foothill north bakersfield attempt warp physical reality match twist hallucination california s water engineer trump s order follow week ignorant bluster catastrophic los angeles wildfire prevent state official turn mythical valve send water southern california trump display demonstrable knowledge wildfire work los angeles vulnerable catastrophic firestorm past month region receive 0 16 inch rainfall since june full four inch average dry stretch 60 year drought exacerbate climate change lack rainfall make grass scrub foothill meet los angeles cityscape planner call urban wild interface tinderbox trump whose idea get nature play 18 hole manicure golf course can t seem fathom canyon brushlands surround america s 2 large metropolis don t benefit sprinkler irrigation,Donald Trump,-33,positive,topic_2,Surrey BC Canada

mmopj0x,Reddit,2025-04-12T07:53:47Z,"I think the ""swing voters defining the election""  is mostly a myth.  Or at least it isn't the complete picture and it's more complicated than that because there's more than one set of moving parts in our elections.  I think what decides the election more so is voter participation.   Not independent voters who swing back and forth, but apathetic people, usually Democrats, who only show up when passions sweep them up.  

This is why they Republicans try to suppress voter participation by making it more inconvenient, and Democrats always try to get people to turn out by making it easier to cast a ballot.  There are more people that favor Democratic policies and if they do vote more often than not they vote for Democrats.


Republicans fall in line, always.  The nature of the right wing is they will line up and support whoever gets the nomination.   They are reliable voters, even if they may be less numerous overall.   They value the chain of command, respect authority, etc.  So even if they were not thrilled with Donald Trump, you don't abandon your team because the QB is weak this season.  

Democrats must fall in love to vote.   This is why Obama won, but Hillary didn't.    M
Biden I think was kind of an exception because Democrats were so passionate in their hate against Trump that they were really to vote for anyone to get rid of him.  

So many Democrats this time we're not passionate about the election after 4 years with Biden because voters on the left always let perfect be the enemy of progress.  Democratic lawmakers do disappoint... I'm not going to pretend that they are perfect.  They aren't, but voters get discouraged and stop showing up after one presidential term if everything they wanted doesn't get done.   Joe didn't didn't he get us universal health care??  We lost abortion?! ""Genocide""?! He didn't forgive student loans (even though the save plan made some PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL moves to provide relief.... that the media didn't report on.)  

I even saw liberals/american left say with complete confidence that better was 'built to fail"" because Biden knew manchin and sinema would never vote for the social aspects, etc.  Maybe, but... Maybe we just needed more than a fucking 50% majority in the Senate?  Nope. Everything is conspiracy!

so instead of using BBB failure as a rallying cry to organize and push harder for more Democrats, they use it as a justification for cynicism and apathy.  

So sure there are some people that may have pivoted, but I think the bigger cause was the number of people that JUST STAYED HOME and protested the election where they didn't like either option (and apparently don't care about state and local).  Never mind that having a choice is infinitely better than NO choice at all, like so many people in the world get.  But lots of Americans take democracy for granted I've learned.   Too many people look at their vote like it's a personal reflection of all of their values rather than a practical step they can take to move the world in a different direction.  Not that I don't want to see our Democratic institutions improved, but I still will take imperfect ones over none at all— because we are quickly headed down that path now because people were so damn apathletic to show up and vote for the candidate that most closely resembled themself and actually had a shot at winning.  

More eligible voters didn't vote than ANY OTHER option.   Maybe this should  trigger some kind of runoff or the election has to happen again with new candidates. 

The second biggest amount voted for somebody other than Trump.


The third biggest amount voted for Trumop. 


The first group is aware of the rules, and they could've had an impact.  Now of course, 2 million Democrats voted in California wouldn't have made a difference. 

But if everybody voted all if the time, this country could look so much different.

mn5sffp,Reddit,2025-04-15T04:09:56Z,"This may be wishful thinking, but I suspect that the Supreme Court may draw a line here.

My reason isn't so wishful.  Judges in American courts are highly protective of their authority.  Snub one of their rulings or act out of order in their presence, and they will predictably get agitated about it.

This is true across the spectrum.  Federal or state/local.  Liberal, conservative, or anywhere in between: Piss off a judge and you're hosed.

I believe that they may start holding these DOJ lawyers in contempt and fining them personally for every day that their orders are defied.  The Supreme Court will back them on this because they also don't like their rulings being disrespected.  What they won't want is another branch of government treating them as if they have no power.

Judges can often be petty and that is usually a bad thing.  This is where it may do some good.

I came across a new AI experiment where two language models were made to debate each other about Donald Trump—one fully supporting him, the other totally against him. It actually turned into a pretty intense back-and-forth on policies, personality, and legacy.

I’m really curious what you all think of this kind of format. Could AI debates actually become a thing in political discourse? Or is it just a gimmick?

Violating the constitution and throwing away our democracy will quickly illegitimate this administration and we could be heading into something far more volatile and possibly violent.

If this administration pushes it further, I honestly see a few outcomes. One where we turn into an authoritarian regime where protesters could indeed be sent to off-country prison (violent in one way I guess).

The other one would be where the judiciary (SCOTUS) challenges the executive and go full force. Without the support of legislative branch, impeachment would be unlikely.

Third is the case where the rising concerns in authoritarianism forces liberal states to declare state of emergency and we head into a civil war, which is unlikely but where we are was also very unlikely event. Some of these democrat politicians would actually need to risk it all and grow some back bones and put it all on the line for democracy. Again, something I don't believe will happen because the rampant corruption in Democratic Party is part of the reason that we're in this mess. They made it easier for republicans to point fingers at given so many questionable practices from the likes of Nancy Pelosi and what not.

The fourth is that citizens revolt against tyranny like we did against the British. This would require a central leadership that would lead this effort, which is highly unlikely in American culture. It would also require citizens to be educated and smart. I feel like years of efforts on making Americans stupid has paid off and most folks can't think for themselves so I wouldn't count on this outcome.

The focus is primarily on Russia – the foreign power most often alleged to have sway over Trump – though we remain open to any foreign influence. The analysis draws on a forensic review of documented evidence: Trump’s business dealings, communications, official policies, intelligence and congressional reports, media investigations, and whistleblower or insider accounts. We will also consider counterarguments and alternative explanations for Trump’s behavior, applying Occam’s Razor to weigh the simplest, most plausible explanation for the observed patterns.""

>That is lower than experts expected, and marks a six-month low for annual inflation. **But the data precedes Trump's imposition of 10 percent baseline tariffs against all of the U.S. trading partners, and 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imported goods, which are expected to put upward pressure on the price of everyday goods.**

>**But BLS numbers do not report the drops in grocery prices the president celebrated in his social media post.** According to the latest BLS report, goods prices—excluding food and energy—moved higher by 0.2 percent in March. Food prices at the grocery store jumped even higher, increasing 0.5 percent from February, when prices remained relatively flat compared to the month before.

>Egg prices, in particular, **continued to climb** despite recent efforts by the Trump administration to combat the shortage brought about by the ongoing bird flu with imports of Turkish eggs. The CPI egg index jumped by 5.9 percent from February and was up 60.4 percent compared to March 2024, and the average price for a dozen grade A large eggs climbed 5.6 percent to a record $6.23.

>The cost of apparel, which depends heavily on imports, **went up by 0.7 percent** in March compared to February.

>According to the latest data provided by AAA, the price of gas at the pump is going down as the president said. The average nationwide price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.169 on Wednesday, down from $3.235 a week before and from $3.644 a year before, **but up from $3.076 only a month earlier.**

mnj75n2,Reddit,2025-04-17T07:31:30Z,That actually is quite common. Food deserts is the usual term. Poor communities especially ones with higher crime or particularly remote tend to not attract the big box grocery stores ergo the rise of dollar stores. These for many people are their only source of groceries but they sell at a much higher price relative to the same good you would get at the major chains (because smaller relative size). The various big chains Walmarts etc that do move into poor or rural areas are often the sole competition (or else put local grocers out of business) and thus can raise prices as they are local monopolies. Poor Americans especially those without cars or who are in remote area just get fleeced. That being said even in my relatively well off area I still notice higher egg prices and general grocery prices (4.50 for eggs down from the like 5.50 and no eggs available but that is for the smallest set of eggs whereas my preferred jumbo eggs which I used to get for like 1.50 are like 5.50 to 6 not worth it unless I really need eggs for cooking but they actually have eggs as they were out for like 2 weeks).,actually quite common food desert usual term poor community especially one high crime particularly remote tend attract big box grocery store ergo rise dollar store many people source grocery sell much high price relative good get major chain small relative size various big chain walmarts etc move poor rural area often sole competition else put local grocer business thus can raise price local monopoly poor american especially without car remote area just get fleece say even relatively good area still notice high egg price general grocery price 4 50 egg like 5 50 egg available small set egg whereas prefer jumbo egg use get like 1 50 like 5 50 6 worth unless really need egg cook actually egg like 2 week,Donald Trump,10,negative,topic_2,LAGOS-NIGERIA

mnk64yq,Reddit,2025-04-17T13:13:18Z,"According to CNN pollster Harry Enten, Trump's net approval rating among independents has gone from negative 16 percent in 2017 to negative 22 percent in 2025, meaning the president has ""broken his own record.""



Independent voters were a key pillar of Trump's coalition in the 2024 election, with 46 percent backing him—up from 41 percent in 2020, when a majority (54 percent) voted Democrat. But that support appears to be eroding in the wake of the president's sweeping tariff announcement on April 2, which rattled the markets before a partial pause temporarily stabilized them.

Since then, however, Trump's approval among independents has not recovered.

Newsweek's analysis of every poll conducted after April 2 that includes independent voter data finds his net approval currently stands at -17 points, with just 37 percent approving and 54 percent disapproving. His lowest rating came from a YouGov poll conducted April 7–10, where only 30 percent of independents approved of his performance while 61 percent disapproved—a net approval of -31 points",accord cnn pollster harry enten trump s net approval rate among independent go negative 16 percent 2017 negative 22 percent 2025 mean president break record independent voter key pillar trump s coalition 2024 election 46 percent back 41 percent 2020 majority 54 percent vote democrat support appear erode wake president s sweep tariff announcement april 2 rattle market partial pause temporarily stabilize since however trump s approval among independent recover newsweek s analysis every poll conduct april 2 include independent voter datum find net approval currently stand 17 point just 37 percent approve 54 percent disapprove low rate come yougov poll conduct april 7 10 30 percent independent approve performance 61 percent disapprove net approval 31 point,Donald Trump,6,positive,topic_1,Leibnitz

Seriously.  This whole ordeal can be stopped by about half a dozen Republicans.  

  
Threaten to leave the party, go independent, and caucus with Democrats to appoint a new House and Senate speaker.  It would take, what, 3?  Maybe 4 Republicans in each chamber to flip control of Congress.   You don't even have to hold your nose and vote with Democrats on actual funding bills or anything.  Just vote with Dems on curtailing Trump's actions and impeaching the fucking bastard.   Even if you can't get him removed from office because the rest of your party are spineless cowards, you could at least pass bills to do things like reverse these stupid tariffs and ***actually reclaim power that was granted to you by the Constitution in the first fucking place***.

But if all you're going to do is complain about being ""afraid"" when you're simultaneously rubber-stamping his entire agenda, then have a coke and a smile and shut the fuck up, because you voted for this.

mnm7cy3,Reddit,2025-04-17T20:11:52Z,"Trump is trying to cause an economic collapse and social chaos.

Sabotaging the economy will provide a reason to declare a state of emergency and seize all powers. The [Insurrection Act of 1807](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act_of_1807) is a United States federal law that empowers the president of the United States to deploy the U.S. military and federalized National Guard troops within the United States in particular circumstances, such as to suppress civil disorder, insurrection, or rebellion. With an economic crash, this ~~administration~~ gang of gangsters hope for riots and unrest, which would allow Trump to invoke this Act.

This seizing of powers during a time of crisis has initially been proposed by the reactionary and extreme libertarian [Curtis Yavin](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/21/curtis-yarvin-trump), which is basically saying that since liberal and progressive America is headed towards a crisis that will impair the democracy and cripple most of the institutions that provide its checks and balances, then a Ceasar like figure should emerge and take powers, like some kind of *benevolent dictator*. In this sick fantasy he argues that progressive ideals have led to societal decay and advocates for a reboot of society. I believe the Trump ~~administration~~ gangsters - who are influenced by [Yavin's ideas](https://www.advocate.com/election/jd-vance-dictator-endorsement) - are pursuing this sick fantasy. 

The CPAC that is trying to arrange for trump to stay beyond two terms, even arrogantly put a picture of [Trump as Caesar](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8weOaUqgFTBJ_qFM_lQZ9w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTEyOTI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/buzzfeed_articles_778/7f7f387417299b29e7b450f66c960be8) as their logo. Trump himself is now overtly [gloating that there are ""methods""](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752) for him to stay (as per my first paragraph).

That method probably now includes a strategy on how to capture all states, by way of Gerrymandering pushed at exponential levels, since many States' Supreme Courts and Governors positions have been taken over by MAGA pundits. (I'm happy that the Wisconsin Supreme Court has resisted this trend; some good news in this sea of gloomy news). 

Reducing the freedom of reporters, and barring print and TV media, or at minimum providing intense government pressure over them to control the narrative (as we've seen for Associated Press and the Gulf of ~~America~~ Mexico debacle) is part of the plan.

Taking over and crippling USPS (as we've seen in the past few days), starting by [firing its head](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/24/nx-s1-5338948/usps-head-louis-dejoy-steps-down-as-trump-officials-consider-postal-service-overhaul) and [""overhauling"" the service](https://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/story/news/2025/04/03/usps-changes-to-affect-mail-delivery-see-why-when-it-starts/82794301007) is for the purpose of controlling mail, and destroying the possibilities to have fair vote by mail.

[Firing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5305288/trump-fires-chairman-joint-chiefs-of-staff-charles-brown-pentagon) and putting one of his cronies in charge, is to be able to have martial law and use the army against the citizens, if need be. And now [more senior military and intelligence figures](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/national-security-agency-chief-deputy-director-dismissed-rcna199647) are being fired and will be replaced by docile elements. Some of these very competent people are even being fired due to [crazy lobbyists having access to Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/03/nsa-director-fired-tim-haugh). With these high ranking people put aside, it's likely that a planned invasion of Greenland (AKA Denmark, a NATO ally and a European country!) could be started. 

Closing the Department of Education, ending funding to universities, ending affirmative action programs, will ensure that access to a good education stays limited and unaffordable to at least half the population and for poorest and most discriminated against citizens (in the USA half the population has access to a few percentage of the wealth).

Having poorly educated constituents, will make manipulation of people easier, simply using populist slogans and empty promises. Uneducated people can be made to worry about bogus social issues such as a few trans athletes, while ignoring major issues such as society's wealth [being funneled to an extremely small percentage of the population](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/a-visual-breakdown-of-who-owns-americas-wealth).

Massacring Medicaid and Medicaid will contribute to keep the poorest 50% of the population from having easy and universal access to healthcare. This, associated with the education points above, will further contribute to make half the population unable to perform critical thinking, and solely focus on making the ends meet, from paycheck to paycheck. That way, that's less people worrying about their civil rights and being critical of their government.

Firing [JAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Advocate_General%27s_Corps), lawyers, judges, etc. will make fair and unbiased justice unattainable to the average citizens. They are also restraining [the freedom of many law firms](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trump-law-firm-executive-order) and ensuring millions of dollars of free law services flow towards the Federal government. 

**It's a coup.** a slow motion one, but a coup nonetheless.

And the majority of Americans are just too stupid or too blind to see it. (sorry for being blunt). They are transforming the American democracy into an oligarchy. It seems like a conspiracy theory, but it's in plain sight for all to see, announced in the Project 2025 and elsewhere (see my first paragraph).

This is very scary and dangerous, and people need to wake up to the fact that this is not random, **he is following a carefully written democracy ending, martial law enabling agenda.**

So he's a very, very, very old man who operates as if *The West Wing* were a documentary and is so set in his ways he cannot change, no matter how the world changes around him. I would never vote for him over a Democrat, but he would be a much better President than Trump.

While it is technically true the Cabinet would need to be the ones to start the legal process, the process would likely be gamed out and negotiated before this ever happens. There would be a coalition of leaders who would ""game out"" the situation before hand, just like a battle plan in a war.

Impeachment means condemning Trump, and it's already been tried twice. It has proven impossible to pin Trump down on ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" 

The 25th Amendment would allow Congress to blame a third party (Trump's mental decline, or his unfitness specifically) rather than Trump himself. This is crucial, because impeachment means condemning the person. Optically, it's different.

Impeachment is easier on its face, requiring only a majority of the House instead of 2/3 of the House. But if you take a broader, multi-disciplinary perspective, the political ramifications of impeachment, including the condemnation of Trump, as well as the fact that this has been done before, twice, make impeachment a worse option in my opinion.",disagree technically true cabinet need one start legal process process likely gamed negotiate ever happen coalition leader game situation hand just like battle plan war impeachment mean condemn trump s already try twice prove impossible pin trump high crime misdemeanor 25th amendment allow congress blame 3 party trump s mental decline unfitness specifically rather trump crucial impeachment mean condemn person optically s different impeachment easy face require majority house instead 2 3 house take broad multi disciplinary perspective political ramification impeachment include condemnation trump good fact do twice make impeachment bad option opinion,Donald Trump,-7,neutral,topic_1,Earth

mnxgg2o,Reddit,2025-04-19T17:10:07Z,"Of course. The ability to inflict cruelty and violence on people is a form of power and to an authoritarian power and status are the same thing.

This is a reactionary movement, i.e. a movement that believes in a social and moral hierarchy based on identity, tying the believer's self worth and perception of status to it. Acts of cruelty and violence affirm power over people they see as lesser than themselves construct and strengthen this social hierarchy, whereas their feeling that it is also a moral hierarchy (i.e. who you are determines whether you're a good person) stops them from feeling any empathy towards its victims, or any guilt or shame about the actions being done by them or in their name.

In a very zero sum way, they feel better about themselves by harming others they see as beneath them. This applies to the people at the top making the decisions, the officers with this inclination who follow orders, and the supporters watching this happen. None of this is rational, of course, so they don't need to articulate or acknowledge any of it. They just need to feel certain things about certain people and be angry, hateful or fearful enough to fall into this cycle of grievance and hate.

You can tie this directly to most of the extremist right's policies. Abortion laws that seem to be solely about harming women. Laws that serve no purpose but to degrade vulnerable groups (prisoners, immigrants, the poor). The gleeful destruction of institutions that their opponents care about even if it erodes the power of the state they now control. And so on. It's all the same principle where they harm others, in person or by proxy, so they can feel better about themselves.

It's going to go on and on and on, of course, casting an ever wider net around anyone they find undesirable, because this is a beast that needs feeding constantly. It's not as if their ideology actually contains anything else, anything that could lead to something constructive that materially improves their lives. So they'll settle for endless cruelty to feel powerful as a substitute for progress. Better to live under the boot of a dictatorship that ""punishes"" those other people slightly more than it harms everyone else, than to have a more equal society that distributes the material surplus it collectively creates to lift all boats.",course ability inflict cruelty violence people form power authoritarian power status thing reactionary movement e movement believe social moral hierarchy base identity tie believer s self worth perception status act cruelty violence affirm power people see lesser construct strengthen social hierarchy whereas feel also moral hierarchy e determine whether re good person stop feel empathy towards victim guilt shame action do name zero sum way feel good harm other see beneath apply people top make decision officer inclination follow order supporter watch happen none rational course don t need articulate acknowledge just need feel certain thing certain people angry hateful fearful enough fall cycle grievance hate can tie directly extremist right s policy abortion law seem solely harm woman law serve purpose degrade vulnerable group prisoner immigrant poor gleeful destruction institution opponent care even erode power state now control s principle harm other person proxy can feel good s go go course cast ever wide net around anyone find undesirable beast need feed constantly s ideology actually contain anything else anything lead something constructive materially improve life will settle endless cruelty feel powerful substitute progress good live boot dictatorship punish people slightly harm everyone else equal society distribute material surplus collectively create lift boat,President Trump,-21,positive,topic_1,"Highland Falls, NY"
